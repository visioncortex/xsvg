## 1. Overview

xsvg is an XML interchange format — a **graceful-degradation superset of SVG** — that a compiler
lowers to a **static SVG subset** renderable in any SVG engine. The win should cost one tag-swap or
one attribute, and nothing added can break the file. Design rationale is in [Syntax.md](Syntax.md).

## 2. Namespaces & the prefix policy [implemented]

| Namespace | URI |
|---|---|
| SVG | `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` |
| xsvg extensions | `https://xsvg.visioncortex.org` (conventional prefix `x:`) |

The document root MAY be `<svg>` (with `xmlns:x` declared) or `<xsvg>` (an alias the compiler treats
as `<svg>`). Naming rules:

| Kind | Rule |
|---|---|
| A name SVG/CSS already defines | use it **unprefixed**, with SVG/CSS semantics (`inline-size`, `text-align`, `<textArea>`, `text-overflow`) |
| A new attribute on a standard element | **`x:`-prefixed** (`x:fit`, `x:width-profile`) |
| A new element | **`x:`-prefixed** (`<x:textbox>`, `<x:vstroke>`, `<x:mesh>`, `<x:boolean>`) |
| Attributes inside an `x:` element | **unprefixed** (the element disambiguates) |

## 3. Degradation contract [implemented]

| Input | Plain SVG viewer | xsvg compiler |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown attribute on a known element | ignores it (element still renders) | applies it |
| Unknown element (`x:` or a revived-but-unsupported SVG element like `<textArea>`) | skips it (content not rendered) | lowers it to the SVG subset |
| Everything else | renders normally | passes through |

A document MUST remain well-formed SVG/XML; the compiler MUST NOT require anything a plain SVG viewer
would reject.

## 4. Processing model [implemented]

```
parse → resolve → lower (quality-parameterized) → emit SVG subset
```

Lowering that needs **font metrics** obtains them through a host-supplied *measurer*: a function
returning, for a string at a size, its advance width and the font's vertical metrics
(`ascent`, `descent`, `cap_height`, `x_height`). In v0 the browser supplies this via canvas
`measureText`; defaults approximate `ascent 0.8em, descent 0.2em, cap_height 0.7em, x_height 0.5em`.
Architecture: [Plan.md §1](Plan.md).

Shape geometry for region flow (§6.10) is obtained through a parallel *shaper* seam: it rasterizes a
filled path into coarse per-row inside-spans. In v0 the browser supplies it (`getBBox` +
`isPointInFill`); a pure-Rust backend can slot in behind the same trait later.

**Reference resolution (normative).** The `in="#id"` attribute (`<x:textbox>` §6.10, `<x:textpath>`
§6.13, `<x:warp field="bend">` §7.3) and `<use href>` operands inside `<x:boolean>` (§7.4) resolve
to geometry by target kind:

- A **plain SVG shape** (`rect`, `path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polygon`, `polyline`)
  contributes its own source geometry.
- A **plain `<g>`** contributes the union of its shape descendants; transforms compose down the
  tree and nested `x:` elements resolve as below. (Children with no geometry — text, `<defs>`,
  live `<use>` — are skipped, not fatal.)
- An **`x:` element** contributes its **compiled output**: the target is lowered as if in place and
  every `<path d>` it emits is concatenated into one (possibly multi-subpath) region. Referenced
  **text auto-outlines**: the resolution pass forces `outline="true"` semantics so a referenced
  textbox contributes its glyph geometry (while itself still rendering live). Output containing a
  path under `fill-rule="evenodd"` is **resolved through the boolean engine** so the borrowed
  region equals the *painted* region. Features therefore chain by reference — a textbox can flow
  inside a boolean union, type can be set on the spine an `x:warp` emitted, and a
  `path → x:warp → x:textpath` chain re-derives end-to-end from one edit (the incremental
  `dependents` scan is a transitive closure over these edges — [Incremental.md](Incremental.md)).
- The target's **own `transform` is honored** — borrowed geometry lands where the user sees the
  target, not where its untransformed source is. A transform **nested deeper** in an `x:` target's
  output (e.g. on a warp's child) cannot be honored by the flat harvest and degrades with a marker
  instead of silently mis-placing geometry.
- A **reference cycle** (the target is already being resolved somewhere up the chain) is a
  degradation, not an error: the cyclic edge resolves to nothing and the referrer falls back exactly
  as for a missing target (§3) — compilation always terminates.
- **Chain depth is bounded** (v0: 32 links). Element nesting is capped at 512 (§4 *Robustness*),
  but reference chains run between *siblings*, so they get their own, lower cap — each link
  recurses through a full emitter, and totality must hold on wasm's small stack. A deeper chain
  degrades at the cap. Within one compile, **context-free resolutions are memoized** (a target
  referenced N times lowers once) and total resolutions are **fuel-bounded** (v0: 65 536) — the
  depth cap bounds how deep a resolution tree goes, the fuel how wide, so cycle-poisoned fan-out
  (which the memo must not cache) exhausts fuel instead of time.
- Every failed resolution emits a marker (§3) **naming the reason** — target not found, no path
  geometry, chain too deep, budget exhausted, nested transform — so a blank chain is diagnosable
  from the output alone.

*Approximation note.* A referenced `x:` output is already flattened and quantized at the profile
tolerance (§7.1), and the consumer approximates again — each link compounds roughly one tolerance
of error. Negligible at `balanced`; on deep chains at `fast`, prefer a tighter profile.

**Robustness (normative).** Compilation is total on well-formed input: degenerate geometry
(zero/negative width, height, padding, or `font-size`), degenerate spacing (negative
`letter-spacing`/`word-spacing`), and pathological measurer output (non-finite or negative advances)
must never panic and must never emit `NaN`/`inf` coordinates — they collapse to empty or zero-sized
output instead. **Element nesting is bounded** at a fixed depth (v0: 512); deeper input is rejected
with an error rather than risking a parser stack overflow. Malformed XML returns an error.

## 5. Graphics elements (reused SVG) [implemented]

`<g>`, `<path>`, basic shapes, gradients, `transform`, `fill`/`stroke` are normalized or passed
through. Defined lowerings:

- **`<rect>`** with no `rx`/`ry` → `<path>`; rounded rects pass through unchanged.

**Passthrough (normative).** Any element in the **SVG namespace** the compiler doesn't recognize —
filters, gradients, masks, markers, `foreignObject`, future or unknown elements — passes through
**verbatim** (re-escaped), with all attributes and children, recursively. Namespace normalization:
`xlink:*` attributes modernize to the unprefixed SVG 2 form (`xlink:href` → `href`; no xlink xmlns
is declared); `xml:*` keeps its reserved prefix (`xml:space`, `xml:lang`); **foreign-namespace
elements and attributes** (editor metadata such as `sodipodi:`/`inkscape:`) are **dropped** —
elements with a marker comment, attributes silently — since they cannot be re-emitted faithfully.
**Static-subset enforcement (Plan R6, shipped):** `<script>`, `<animate>`, `<animateMotion>`,
`<animateTransform>`, `<set>`, and `<discard>` are **dropped with markers** — they cannot exist
in the §9 output contract — and `on*` event attributes strip silently.

### 5.1 Layers — compile-time z-order [implemented]

SVG has no layers, only document order (§ painter's algorithm). xsvg adds **compile-time
restacking** the degradation-safe way — as `x:`-prefixed attributes on a plain `<g>` (§2), exactly
the shape of Inkscape's `inkscape:groupmode="layer"`. A layered file is **valid SVG that renders
in any plain viewer** (in document order); the compiler reorders and strips the metadata.

```xml
<g x:layer="foreground" x:label="Badge" x:order="10"> … </g>   <!-- floats in front -->
<g x:label="Card"> … </g>                                       <!-- content band, stays put -->
<g x:layer="background"> … </g>                                 <!-- sinks behind -->
```

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `x:layer` | z-band: **`background`** sinks (−1), **`foreground`** floats (+1), any other value is the content band (0) |
| `x:order` | within-band z-key (number, default 0); also works standalone as a plain z-index on any sibling |
| `x:label` | human name — authoring metadata, stripped |
| `x:hidden` | any value but `false` → the element and its subtree **compile to nothing** (the eyeball toggle) |

**Model (normative).** Within a parent, direct children stable-sort by the key
`(band, x:order, document-index)`. Loose (non-layer) content is band 0 / order 0, so it keeps its
document position and only bucketed or explicitly-ordered elements move. Restacking triggers when
any direct child carries `x:layer` or `x:order`; in a restacked container, insignificant
whitespace text nodes are dropped. The `x:` attributes are stripped on emit (a layer becomes a
plain `<g>`), so the output carries no trace of the layering. Because `<x:layer>` as an *element*
would hide its content in an uncompiled viewer (§3 skips unknown elements with their subtree), the
**attribute-on-`<g>` form is the primitive** — it never degrades to empty.

### 5.2 Artboards — named slide frames [implemented]

An artboard is a `<g x:artboard="Label">` — a named region, like an Illustrator artboard or a
slide. Degradation-safe the same way as layers (§5.1): it compiles to a plain `<g>` (renders
normally in any viewer) carrying **`data-xsvg-artboard="Label"`**, so tools can enumerate, frame,
and page through them. An optional `x:frame="x y w h"` sets an explicit slide rectangle (content
may bleed past it) and is echoed as **`data-xsvg-frame`**; without it, tools fall back to the
group's bounding box.

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `x:artboard` | marks the group as an artboard; the value is its name |
| `x:frame` | optional explicit frame `x y w h` (else the group's bbox) |

**Tooling.** The bundled tools treat artboards as **slides**: the standalone preview shows a
`‹ ›` nav with a slide counter when a document has multiple artboards, paging by reframing the SVG
`viewBox` to each frame; the interactive viewer **zooms to the first artboard** on load. Both read
the frames from the emitted `data-` attributes (`web/src/core/artboards.ts`). The compiler itself
only tags and passes through — artboards do not reorder or clip content.

## 6. Text

### 6.1 Common layout primitives [implemented]

- **Measurement.** Words are measured once at the base size; trial sizes scale widths linearly.
- **Wrapping.** Greedy (first-fit): break only at whitespace. A token wider than the available width
  is placed alone (it overflows; see §6.6). No automatic hyphenation in v0.
- **Fitting** (shrink-to-fit, `<x:textbox>` only). Binary-search the font size in
  `[fit-min, font-size]` for the largest whose wrapped block fits the box height; re-wrap each trial.

### 6.2 `<text>` and `inline-size` — Rung 1 [implemented]

Point `<text>` passes through. With **`inline-size="W"`**, the text wraps to width `W` and flows
downward; the **first line's baseline is at `y`** (the SVG `<text>` convention), and subsequent
baselines step by `line-height · font-size` (default `line-height` = 1.2). Horizontal alignment uses
the inherited `text-anchor`.

### 6.3 `<textArea>` — Rung 2, SVG Tiny 1.2 subset [implemented]

Flowed text in a region, per the SVG Tiny 1.2 Recommendation.

| Property / attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x`, `y` | length | 0 | region corner |
| `width`, `height` | length \| `auto` | `auto` | `width:auto` ⇒ no wrap; `height:auto` ⇒ grow (no clip) |
| `text-align` | `start` \| `end` \| `center` \| `justify` | `start` | inline alignment (`justify` extends Tiny 1.2 — §6.9) |
| `display-align` | `auto` \| `before` \| `center` \| `after` | `auto` (= `before`) | block alignment |
| `line-increment` | `auto` \| `<number>` | `auto` | line-box height; `auto` = 1.1 × font-size |

**Layout.** Wrap to the width (or not, if `auto`). Baselines **step by `line-increment`** (the SVG Tiny
1.2 line-box height). `display-align` then positions the **cap-height ink band** (§6.5) —
`before`=cap-top at the top edge, `center`=band centred, `after`=band bottom at the bottom edge — so
centred text is optically centred, not biased low by the em box. With an explicit `height`, lines whose
ink band falls outside the region are **not rendered** (clipped; see §6.6).

**`<tbreak/>`** [implemented] — a forced line break, per SVG Tiny 1.2. Each `<tbreak/>` child ends the
current line and starts a new one; wrapping resumes independently on each side. Consecutive breaks
produce blank lines. This is the only child element `<textArea>` interprets in v0.

**Not yet implemented:** `xml:space="preserve"`, full UAX #14 line-breaking (we break on
whitespace), `editable`.

### 6.4 `<x:textbox>` — Rung 3, xsvg box [implemented]

Box text with diagram ergonomics. Shares `<textArea>`'s cap-height vertical model, differing in line
spacing (`line-height` vs `line-increment`) and keyword (`valign` vs `display-align`); see §6.5.

| Attr | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x`,`y`,`width`,`height` | length | — | box geometry (ignored when `in` is set) |
| `in` | `#id` | — | bind to a referenced shape (§6.10) |
| `padding` | length | 0 | uniform content inset |
| `align` | `start` \| `center` \| `end` \| `justify` | `start` | horizontal alignment (§6.9) |
| `valign` | `top` \| `middle` \| `bottom` | `top` | vertical alignment |
| `fit` | `none` \| `shrink` | `none` | shrink-to-fit (§6.1) |
| `fit-min` | length | 6 | font-size floor for `shrink` |
| `line-height` | number | 1.2 | line advance multiplier |

### 6.5 Vertical alignment model (normative) [implemented]

Both box elements align on the **cap-height band** — the region from the first line's **cap-top** to
the last line's **baseline + descent** — positioning it optically rather than centring the em box
(which would sit low, since ascent > cap-height). They differ only in **line spacing** and the
keyword: `<textArea>` steps by `line-increment` and takes `display-align` (`before`/`center`/`after`);
`<x:textbox>` steps by `line-height · font-size` and takes `valign` (`top`/`middle`/`bottom`).

**Baseline-stability invariant (both):** alignment reserves the *font's* descent (a constant), not
the per-string ink. Therefore a descender-free and a descender-bearing label in the same box land on
the **same baseline** — descenders fill the reserved descent rather than shifting the text. This MUST
hold for every alignment.

### 6.6 Overflow & truncation — `text-overflow` [implemented]

Applies to box-bound text (`<textArea>`, `<x:textbox>`); not to point text or `inline-size` flow.

- **`text-overflow`** : `clip` *(initial)* | `ellipsis`. Unprefixed (CSS/SVG 2 name). `clip` is the
  default and reproduces SVG Tiny 1.2 behavior.

**Overflow axes.** *Block:* more wrapped lines than fit the content height. *Inline:* a line wider
than the content width (an unbreakable token).

**Order.** Resolve font size (apply `fit` first) → wrap → compute the fitting line count `C` (lines
whose box lies within the height; `C` = all if height is `auto`) → apply `text-overflow`:

- **`clip`** — render lines `0 … C−1`; drop the rest. Inline overflow renders past the box (a clip
  path MAY be emitted at higher quality).
- **`ellipsis`** — render `0 … C−1`; if lines were dropped, the **last rendered line** is ellipsized;
  any rendered line wider than the content width is ellipsized. If `C = 0`, render nothing.

**Fit vs. truncate (not contradictory — sequential).** `fit` and truncation answer two different
questions: *should the font adapt to the box?* and *what becomes of whatever still overflows?*
`fit="shrink"` reduces *how much* overflows by shrinking the font, but only down to the `fit-min`
legibility floor; `text-overflow` then handles the residual at that floor. So truncation fires
**only when fit bottoms out at `fit-min` and the text still doesn't fit** — with no floor (or a
generous one) fit wins and nothing is truncated; with no `fit`, `text-overflow` acts at the authored
size. `text-overflow` is a single, general overflow control, independent of fitting.

**Ellipsizing a line** (`line`, `max_width`, marker `E` = `…` U+2026):
1. If `width(E) > max_width`, render nothing.
2. Strip trailing whitespace, then trim trailing **characters** until `width(line + E) ≤ max_width`
   (re-stripping exposed whitespace), so the result reads `word…` not `word …`.
3. If `line` is emptied, render just `E`.
4. Emit `line + E`.

Trimming is by character (CSS-like). v0 truncates at the **inline end** only; the marker is a single
`…` glyph. A future `x:ellipsis` MAY allow a custom marker.

| Edge case | Result |
|---|---|
| empty / whitespace-only | nothing |
| box too short for one line (`C=0`) | nothing |
| box narrower than `…` | nothing |
| text fits | no marker (== `clip`) |
| line trims to empty before `…` fits | just `…` |

**Differs from CSS/SVG 2:** one property covers **both** block (multi-line, like `-webkit-line-clamp`)
and inline overflow; implemented by emitting `<tspan>`s, so it renders without SVG-2 support.

### 6.7 Glyph width scaling — `x:glyph-x-scale` [implemented]

A purely **visual** horizontal scale on rendered glyphs. Applies to all three text front-ends:
unprefixed `glyph-x-scale` on `<x:textbox>`; `x:`-prefixed `x:glyph-x-scale` on plain-SVG `<text
inline-size>` and `<textArea>` (the prefix policy of §3 — a new attribute on a reused SVG element is
namespaced).

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `glyph-x-scale` | `<number>` | `1` | multiply each line's advance width by this factor |

**Lowering.** Per emitted line, the compiler measures the natural advance `w`, then emits
`textLength="w · scale" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"` on the `<tspan>`. Renderers stretch/compress
the glyphs and inter-glyph spacing to hit that length. **Layout is unchanged** — wrapping, fitting and
overflow all run at the natural width; only the final rendered glyphs are scaled. A value of `1` (the
initial) emits nothing. Empty lines are left untouched. When combined with `letter-spacing` (§6.8),
the `textLength` target is computed from the letter-spaced advance so the two compose.

### 6.8 Letter & word spacing — `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing` [implemented]

CSS/SVG tracking: uniform extra space between grapheme clusters (`letter-spacing`) and at each
inter-word gap (`word-spacing`), on every text element (unprefixed — both are existing SVG/CSS
names, §3).

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `letter-spacing` | `normal` \| `<length>` | `normal` (= 0) | extra advance added per inter-grapheme gap |
| `word-spacing` | `normal` \| `<length>` | `normal` (= 0) | extra advance added per inter-word space |

**Model (normative).** Both are **absolute lengths** in user units — they do *not* scale with
`font-size` (so under shrink-to-fit the spacing stays put while glyphs shrink), matching CSS/SVG. They
are **additive on top of kerning**, not a replacement: the font's pair kerning stays in the glyph
advances (whatever the measurer models — real for canvas, none for the test fixtures) and the spacing
is layered over it. The rendered advance of a run of *n* grapheme clusters containing *s* inter-word
spaces is:

```
advance = kerned_advance(run) + (n − 1) × letter-spacing + s × word-spacing
```

**Layout-aware.** This spaced advance — not the raw glyph advance — drives wrapping, shrink-to-fit,
ellipsis truncation and alignment, so tracked text breaks and fits correctly. The attributes are then
emitted on the output `<text>` (or forwarded on a passed-through `<text inline-size>`); the renderer
reproduces exactly the width layout assumed. `normal` and `0` emit nothing. Counts use code points in
v0 (grapheme-cluster segmentation is a future refinement; wrapped lines join words with a single
space, so the inter-word count is exact); `font-kerning` is left at the renderer default (`normal`).

### 6.9 Justification — `text-align="justify"` / `align="justify"` [implemented]

Full-justify on the box front-ends (`<textArea>` via `text-align`, `<x:textbox>` via `align`). The
value `justify` extends the SVG Tiny 1.2 `text-align` vocabulary with the CSS/SVG 2 value (§3).

**Model (normative).** After wrapping, a line is **justified** — stretched to the content width — iff
**all** of:
- alignment is `justify` and the box has a **positive, known content width** (auto-width `<textArea>`
  has no target, so it degrades to `start`);
- it is **not** the last line of its paragraph (the last line, and the last line before each
  `<tbreak/>`, stay ragged — normal typographic convention);
- it contains **more than one word** (a lone word has nothing to stretch between).

An ellipsized line (§6.6) is never justified. Justified lines anchor at the **start** edge.

**Lowering.** A justified line emits `textLength="<content-width>" lengthAdjust="spacing"` on its
`<tspan>`; the renderer distributes the slack into the inter-glyph/word spacing (glyph shapes are not
scaled — contrast `glyph-x-scale`, §6.7, which uses `spacingAndGlyphs`). On a line that would carry
both, justification wins. v0 distributes slack uniformly across all gaps (not word-gaps-only); a
word-spacing-only composer is a future refinement.

### 6.10 Shape binding & region flow — `<x:textbox in="#id">` [implemented]

Binds a textbox to a referenced shape instead of its own `x/y/width/height`.

- **`in="#id"`** resolves to any element in the document. A missing target renders nothing (a comment
  marker is emitted).
- If the target is a **`rect`**, the textbox uses its box and the rectangular model of §6.4/§6.5 —
  `fit`, `valign`, `padding`, `align` all apply. This is the common "label a box" case.
- **Any other fillable shape** (`path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `polyline`) → text is flowed
  **inside the actual filled outline** (the Vision's *fit-text-in-polygon*): each line is wrapped to
  the shape's inside width *at that height*, so a triangle's lines shorten toward its apex and a
  circle's bulge across the middle.
- An **`x:` element** target contributes its **compiled output** (§4 *Reference resolution*) — text
  flows inside e.g. a `<x:boolean>` union's merged silhouette.

**Geometry seam (normative architecture).** Region geometry is obtained through a host-supplied
*shaper* — the geometric analog of the *measurer* (§4). The shaper rasterizes a filled path into a
coarse table of per-row inside-spans `[left, right]`; the pure layout then flows text into that table
(intersecting spans across each line box so glyphs never cross the outline). In v0 the browser is the
shaper — curve flattening, bounds, and inside-testing are deferred to `getBBox` + `isPointInFill` — and
native tests replay browser-generated raster fixtures. A pure-Rust shaper (flatten + scanline) is a
later backend behind the same seam.

**Alignment.** `align` (`start`/`center`/`end`) positions each line within its own span. `valign`
(`top`/`middle`/`bottom`) positions the flowed block within the region's vertical extent: a first pass
sizes the block, then the flow re-runs from a shifted start (so each line still gets the span at its
final height — a middle-aligned block in a diamond straddles the widest band). The shift clamps to 0
when the block is taller than the region, so it never drops words top-alignment wouldn't.

**v0 scope.** No **shrink-to-fit** in region mode (rect fast-path only). `text-overflow` clips at the
region's bottom and can ellipsize the last line. Vertical resolution is coarse (row height ≈
font-size ⁄ 3). Any outline whose every horizontal slice is a **single run** flows correctly —
including vertical-pinch concavities like an hourglass (lines just narrow at the waist). A row that
splits into **two runs** (a donut, a horizontal bowtie, a `U`) collapses to its outer
`[leftmost, rightmost]` span, so text bridges the gap — v0 has no multi-span rows. A word wider than a
line's span still overflows the outline (the usual lone-word rule) unless `text-overflow="ellipsis"`
trims it.

### 6.11 Styled runs — `<tspan>` [implemented]

Inline styling inside `<textArea>` and `<x:textbox>`: a child `<tspan>` is a **run** whose text
shares the surrounding paragraph but overrides its paint/style. This reuses SVG's own inline-span
element (§3, reuse-unprefixed) — the same `<tspan>` the compiler emits, now also read on input.

| Overridable on a run | Notes |
|---|---|
| `fill` | per-run colour |
| `font-weight`, `font-style` | e.g. bold / italic words |
| `font-family` | per-run typeface |

**Model (normative).** Runs affect a word's **advance** (weight/style/family change glyph widths), so
each word is measured in its own run style and wrapping stays correct; a run boundary may fall
mid-word (two pieces, no break between them). **`font-size` is not overridable in v0** — mixed sizes
would perturb line-height and baseline; runs share the paragraph size, `letter-spacing`, and
`word-spacing`. Nested `<tspan>`s compose (inner wins). `<tbreak/>` still breaks across runs.

**Lowering.** Each output line is one positioning `<tspan x y>` (which also carries any justify /
`glyph-x-scale` `textLength`); within it, base-styled text is emitted bare and each run becomes a
nested `<tspan>` carrying only the attributes that differ from the base `<text>`. So a plain paragraph
emits exactly as before (no nested spans). Ellipsis truncates from the last run inward.

**v0 limits.** Styled runs apply to the rectangular box front-ends (`<textArea>`, `<x:textbox>` — incl.
`in="#rect"`); curved-shape region flow (§6.10) and `<text inline-size>` flatten runs to the base
style. Per-run `stroke` and `font-size` are future work.

### 6.12 Create outlines — `outline="true"` [implemented]

Turn a text element's glyphs into vector `<path>` geometry at compile time ("Create Outlines" in
Illustrator terms). Set `outline="true"` on `<x:textbox>`, or the prefixed `x:outline="true"` on the
reused `<textArea>` (§2). Layout is unchanged — outlining is a purely **emit-time** transform applied
after wrapping, fitting, and alignment have run.

**Model (normative).** Each laid-out line is traced from its text at the element's **base style** and
emitted as a `<path>` inside a single `<g>` that carries the element's paint — `fill` plus any
`stroke*` / `paint-order` (so an outline can be filled, stroked as a keyline, or both). Outlining is
**all-or-nothing per element with graceful fallback**: if the backend cannot outline *every* line
(e.g. the font's bytes are unavailable), the element falls back to live `<text>` unchanged — so an
outline request never breaks a drawing, it only upgrades it when the font is present. Lines are
anchored by their measured width (`text-anchor` start/middle/end resolved to an `x` origin), matching
the live-text placement.

**The seam.** Outlines come from a platform `GlyphOutliner` (parallel to the `Measurer`/`Shaper`
seams of §4): given a run, its style, size, and baseline origin, it returns a path `d` or `None`. The
browser adapter backs it with [opentype.js](https://opentype.js.org) and therefore needs the font's
**bytes** — the host application registers fonts by family (a family with no registered font ⇒ live
`<text>`). Arbitrary installed system fonts are not outlinable this way.

**Fonts by name (reference app).** So a source needn't ship font bytes, the web app resolves a
`font-family="-x-google-<Name>"` marker by fetching that family from Google Fonts once (css2 →
woff2 → decompressed to sfnt by a vendored decoder), then (a) registering it with the outliner and
(b) adding it to the document via `FontFace` so **live `<text>` and canvas metrics** use the real face
too — not only the outlined `<path>`. The marker is stripped to the bare family before compile, so a
resolution failure degrades to the normal live-`<text>` fallback. This is app-level font provisioning,
not part of the interchange format.

**Why.** The drawing then carries the **true display face as geometry** — it renders identically
anywhere, with no font install or `@font-face` embed, at the cost of selectable text (a hidden `<text>`
layer for searchability is future work, §G). This is also the prerequisite for the *text-as-vector-art*
effects of the remaining pillars (§7): geometry warp/envelope and mesh-fill applied to glyph outlines.

**v0 limits.** Outline mode uses the base style per line: per-run styling (§6.11), `justify` (§6.9),
`glyph-x-scale` (§6.7), and `letter-spacing`/`word-spacing` (§6.8) do not apply to the traced path, and
curved-shape region flow (§6.10) keeps its own per-line placement. Per-run outlining is future work.

### 6.13 Text on a path — `<x:textpath>` [implemented: skew, rainbow]

Bind a text run to an open path: the run is laid out on a straight baseline, **outlined** (§6.12), and
its geometry **warped onto the path**. This is a **specialization of the geometry-transform pipeline
(§7)** — the outlined run is the source geometry, and the reference path derives the **field** (§7.2)
that the §7.1 bake applies — and it mirrors Illustrator's *Type on a Path* effects. The `effect`
attribute just **selects the field**: **skew** = the *displacement* field (§6.13.1); **rainbow** =
the *path-follow* field (§6.13.2); **stair** = the displacement field applied **per-glyph** instead
of per-point, on live `<text>` (§6.13.3).

**Surface.**
```xml
<path id="wave" d="M0,40 C60,0 140,80 200,40" fill="none"/>
<x:textpath in="#wave" effect="skew" font-family="-x-google-Anton" font-size="32" fill="#111">rides the wave</x:textpath>
```
- **`in="#id"`** *(required)* — the reference path (an open `<path>` / `<line>` / `<polyline>`, or an
  `x:` element whose **compiled output** supplies the path — §4 *Reference resolution*). Like
  `<x:textbox in="#shape">` and `clipPath`, only its **geometry** is used; its own paint is ignored.
- **`effect`** — `skew` *(default; §6.13.1)* | `rainbow` *(§6.13.2)* | `stair` *(§6.13.3)* |
  `ribbon` *(§6.13.4)* | `follow` *(§6.13.5)*.
- **`baseline-shift`** — length, default `0`: offsets the run's baseline from the path along the
  **local normal** — positive lifts the text above the path, matching SVG `baseline-shift`
  semantics. Applies to every effect (under skew, where the normal is not computed, it is a plain
  vertical lift). Two runs on the same path with opposite shifts sit above and below it.
- **`align`** — `start` *(default)* | `middle` | `end`: where the run sits within the path's
  **extent** — its x-extent under skew, its **arc length** under rainbow. The slack
  (`extent − run width`) may be negative (a run longer than the path); `middle`/`end` then shift
  before the path's start, symmetric with the past-the-end overshoot.
- **`start`** — an absolute head-start (user units) added after `align`: x units under skew, arc
  length under rainbow (default `0`).
- Standard text attributes apply: `font-*`, `fill`, `stroke*` (the emitted outline carries them, §6.12),
  `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing`.
- **Single line only** — a path is a 1-D track, so `inline-size`/wrapping do not apply; a run longer than
  the path's x-extent is clipped at the end.

**Model (normative).** The run is shaped on a flat baseline (`y = 0`, advancing in `x` from `start`),
producing glyph outlines (§6.12). Let **`f(x)`** be the reference path's **height profile** — its `y`
at horizontal position `x`. The compiler samples `f` from the path; the path **SHOULD be single-valued
in `x`**, and where it is not, the first (topmost) `y` at that `x` is used.

**6.13.1 Skew — 1-D vertical displacement [implemented].** The §7.2 **displacement** field: every outline
point maps

> `(x, y) → (x, y + f(x) − baseline-shift)`

so glyphs stay **upright**, vertical strokes stay vertical, and horizontal edges tilt by the local slope
`f'(x)` — the vertical **shear** Illustrator calls *Skew*. There is **no arc-length reparameterization
and no normal offset**, hence no generic path-offsetting — the cheapest field. It runs through the §7.1
bake unchanged (flatten → displace → refit), emitted as one `<path>` per run inside a
`<g fill=… stroke=…>` (exactly as §6.12); the flatten tolerance is the graded quality knob.

**6.13.2 Rainbow — arc-length follow + deform [implemented].** The §7.2 **path-follow** field:
reparameterize by arc length (text-`x` → distance `s` along the path) and map every outline point

> `(x, y) → P(s) + (y − baseline-shift)·N(s)`,  `s = x`

where `P(s)` is the path point at arc length `s` and **`N(s)` is the unit normal — the tangent rotated
+90° in the y-down coordinate system** (for a left→right path `N` points down, so ascenders rise above
the curve and positive `baseline-shift` lifts the run off it). This both rotates *and* deforms glyphs
along the curve: each point is mapped independently, so strokes compress on the inside of a bend and
stretch on the outside. Unlike skew there is **no single-valued-in-`x` restriction** — loops and
vertical segments are fine. **Beyond either end** of the path the frame extends **straight along the
end tangent**, so a run longer than the path continues rather than bunching at the endpoint. **The
bake is native** (§7.1, in `xsvg-core`): the reference path flattens into an arc-length frame, and
the outlined run — the browser supplies only the glyph geometry and its advance width — runs the
standard pipeline with the quality-graded **text tolerance** (0.1 / 0.025 / 0.005 — glyphs are
judged at reading distance, so text bakes tighter than shapes) and adaptive subdivision. For a
*non-deforming* follow, use `effect="follow"` (§6.13.5).

**6.13.3 Stair Step — per-glyph steps, live text [implemented].** The authorable stepped baseline:
glyphs stay upright and **undeformed**; each is absolutely positioned via per-glyph `x`/`y` lists —
`x` from kerned prefix advances plus the §6.8 spacing gaps (honoring `align`/`start`), `y =
f(x_glyph) − baseline-shift` sampled from the **native height profile**. Because it lowers to live
`<text>` (never the outliner), it **needs no font bytes**, stays selectable, and uses the live
face — the one path effect available everywhere (only the *measurer* is required).

**6.13.4 3D Ribbon — normal-offset heights [implemented].** Skew's complement: the baseline rides
the height profile exactly as §6.13.1, but glyph heights offset along the profile's **normal**
instead of straight up —

> `(x, y) → (x, f(x)) + (y − baseline-shift)·N(x)`

with `N(x)` the profile's unit normal. Vertical strokes tilt perpendicular to the path while
horizontal strokes stay parallel to it — the twisting-ribbon look. Like skew (and unlike rainbow)
there is no arc-length reparameterization; the path is read as a height field, single-valued in `x`.

**How the three warping effects relate** — same skeleton, two independent choices:

| effect | glyph advance measured… | glyph "up" points… | consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| skew | along **x** | straight up | upright letters; x-extent preserved |
| ribbon | along **x** | along the **normal** | letters lean with the slope; x-extent preserved, but glyphs stretch by `√(1+f′²)` along steep sections |
| rainbow | along **arc length** | along the **normal** | letters rotate rigidly, constant width/spacing on any curve; the run consumes arc length, not x |

**6.13.5 Follow — SVG's native `<textPath>` [implemented].** The *non-deforming* follow: lowers to
live `<text><textPath href="#id">`, so glyphs stay undeformed and the text stays **selectable** —
the renderer does the following. `align`/`start` compile to `startOffset` (resolved against the
path's arc length and the measured run width); `baseline-shift` is forwarded as the presentation
attribute. Needs no font bytes; the trade-off is renderer-dependent glyph placement and no §7
warping — it is the one effect whose output uses `<textPath>` rather than baked geometry.

**Degradation [implemented].** The warping effects need the glyph outliner (§6.12). If it is
unavailable (no font bytes), the **height-profile effects (skew, ribbon) degrade to the stair-step
lowering** (§6.13.3) — same field, per-glyph instead of per-point. Rainbow, or a run whose height
profile can't be sampled, degrades to a straight `<text>` at the element's `x`/`y` — the document
never breaks.

**v0 limits.** Single line; base style per run (per-run `<tspan>` styling, `justify`, `glyph-x-scale`
do not apply, as §6.12); for skew the path is treated as a height field (single-valued in `x`). The
run width used by `align` matches the geometry being placed: the outline advance for warped runs (no
letter/word-spacing, §6.12), the spacing-inclusive advance for the stepped fallback. The
native-`<textPath>` non-deforming follow is future work.

### 6.14 Lists — `<x:list>` / `<x:li>` [implemented]

A `<x:list>` is a vertical stack of `<x:li>` items, each flowed and wrapped like a mini
`<x:textbox>` but with a **hanging indent**: the marker sits in the gutter and continuation lines
align to the text column, not back under the marker. It is the ordered/unordered list SVG never
got, and lowers to a `<g>` of drawn bullet shapes plus one plain `<text>` of positioned `<tspan>`s
(item text + number/character markers) — live and selectable.

```xml
<x:list x="40" y="80" width="300" list="bullet" font-size="14" item-spacing="5">
  <x:li>Top-level item that wraps under its own text column</x:li>
  <x:li indent="1">A nested item — one indent step in</x:li>
  <x:li indent="2">Deeper still</x:li>
</x:list>
```

| Attribute (on `<x:list>`) | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | `bullet` *(default)* / `number` / `none` | marker style for the whole list (an `<x:li>` may override its own) |
| `marker` | `disc` / `circle` / `square` / `dash`, or any literal string | force a marker: a named **drawn shape**, else a literal text marker (`▸`, `—`, `★`, …); overrides the `list` cycle |
| `marker-size` | number (default `1`) | scale factor on the drawn bullet shapes |
| `marker-fill` | color (default = `fill`) | marker color (shapes and number/character markers) |
| `x` `y` `width` | length | the block's left edge, **top**, and content width; or take them from `in="#rect"`'s bbox |
| `in` | `#id` | bind geometry to a referenced shape's bounding box (a baked reference, §4); also supplies the height for `valign` |
| `valign` | `top` *(default)* / `middle` / `bottom` | vertical placement within the height (from `in="#rect"` or an explicit `height`) |
| `indent` | length (default `1.5em`) | the per-level indent step |
| `marker-gap` | length (default `0.5em`) | gap between the marker and the text column |
| `item-spacing` | length (default `0.35em`) | extra vertical gap between items |
| `font-*`, `line-height`, `fill` | as §6.1 | base style for every item |

Each **`<x:li>`** is one item; `indent="N"` sets its **nesting level** (0 = top). Every level steps
the text column right by `indent` and **cycles the marker**. Bullet markers are **drawn shapes**, not
font glyphs (so they don't vary by font, and are optically balanced): a filled **disc**, a hollow
**ring**, then a filled **square**, repeating every three levels. The shapes are **area-compensated** —
the square's side is `r·√π` so its area equals the disc's (its diagonal stays inside the disc's
diameter), and the ring's outer diameter is enlarged ~12% since a hollow mark reads lighter than a
filled one. Numbers cycle decimal → lower-alpha → lower-roman and keep an **outline counter per
level**, restarted whenever nesting pops back to a shallower level (so `1. 2. a. b. 3.`), right-aligned
into the gutter so `1.` and `10.` share a column edge. An `<x:li marker="…">` (or `marker` on the
list) overrides with a named shape or a literal character. An empty item still advances one line;
`list="none"` suppresses the marker but keeps the indent.

**v0 limits.** Base style per item (inline `<tspan>` styling is not yet applied inside an item); no
shrink-to-fit or height clipping — the list flows from `valign` within the height but doesn't shrink
to fit it; number/roman/character markers are live text (the glyphs must exist in the font), while
bullet shapes are drawn and font-independent.

## 7. Geometry transforms — a generic deformation pipeline [implemented: first slice]

Pillar 2. SVG's `transform` is **affine-only** (`matrix` has an implicit `[0 0 1]` row), so perspective,
warp, and envelope distortions **cannot ride on vector geometry** — xsvg **bakes** them into deformed
paths. The design is deliberately **generic**: one pipeline, a library of pluggable **fields**, and thin
front-ends. Text on a path (§6.13) is *one* front-end; skew / rainbow are *just field functions*.
Grounded in [Research.md §7](Research.md); the capability catalog (Illustrator parity: warp presets,
perspective, envelopes) and build order are in [Transform.md](Transform.md).

### 7.1 The bake (normative) [implemented]

Every geometry transform is the same three steps, parameterized only by a field `D` and a tolerance:

> **flatten → map → refit.** **Flatten** each source path to a polyline within a Hausdorff `tolerance`;
> **map** every vertex through the field `D`; **refit** the mapped polyline to cubic `<path>` segments
> (or emit the polyline directly at low quality).

Bézier curves are affine-invariant, so *affine* `D` may be applied to control points directly — but a
**non-affine `D` must go through flatten→map→refit** (mapping only control points is wrong; error grows
with segment span × field nonlinearity). The **`tolerance` is the graded quality knob**: kurbo's flatten
gives segment count ∝ `tolerance`⁻½, so tightening it trades path size for fidelity. This is the *only*
approximation step; the emitted `<path>` is exact SVG.

**The v1 implementation** (kurbo-backed, in `xsvg-core`, natively tested) runs all three steps.
Chords — including straight source segments and implicit closing edges — are **subdivided
adaptively**: a segment splits while any mapped probe (mid + quarter points) deviates from the
mapped chord *segment* by more than `tolerance` (depth-capped), so long straight edges curve
smoothly under a nonlinear field while line-preserving fields (perspective) emit zero waste. The
**refit** step is implemented at the API level (kurbo's corner-aware simplify, natively tested)
but **disabled in the lowering**: on dense, quantized glyph outlines kurbo 0.13's fitter overshoots
— producing notched edges and hairline slivers — and its optimizing level dominates compile time
(its subdivision level degrades badly on reversed runs). Until a robust fitter lands, **every
profile emits the tolerance-graded polyline** (`M`/`L`/`Z`) — shapes at 1.0 / 0.1 / 0.02 user
units for `fast`/`balanced`/`highest`, glyph runs tighter at 0.1 / 0.025 / 0.005 — which
stays within tolerance of the true mapped geometry by construction. Baked path data serializes
**compactly**: coordinates quantize to a decimal grid (1 decimal at `fast`-shape tolerances, 3 at
the tightest text tolerances, else 2), and everything after each subpath start is emitted as
**relative commands with implicit
repetition** (`M12,80l.6,-.4 .7,-.3…z`); deltas are computed on the grid in integer units, so
rounding never accumulates. This trims dense glyph runs by ~25% at zero geometric risk.

### 7.2 Deformation fields [skew shipped-first]

A **field** is a pure map `D : ℝ² → ℝ²` (a point in source space → output space); a field may precompute
state (e.g. an arc-length table) but exposes only per-point evaluation to the bake. The catalog — all
interchangeable under §7.1:

| Field | `D(x, y)` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **displacement** *(skew, §6.13.1)* | `(x, y + f(x))` | 1-D vertical shift by a height profile `f`; the cheapest field — no arc-length, no offset. **First to ship.** |
| **path-follow** *(rainbow, §6.13.2)* | `P(s) + y·N(s)`, `s = arclen⁻¹(x)` | follow + normal offset ⇒ glyphs deform; arc-length frame + normal offset. **Shipped, native** (§6.13.2) |
| **envelope preset** | analytic (arc / arch / flag / wave / fisheye / twist …) | Illustrator Envelope-Distort presets over the source bbox. **All 15 shipped** (§7.3); full catalog in [Transform.md §B](Transform.md) |
| **perspective** | homography `((ax+cy+e)/(gx+hy+1), (bx+dy+f)/(gx+hy+1))` | 8-DOF projective; SVG can't express it on vectors. **Shipped** (§7.3, `corners`-solved), plus **free** (bilinear) and the distortion-slider taper |
| **FFD** | trivariate/bivariate Bézier lattice (Sederberg-Parry) | editable cage/grid |
| **MLS** | weighted handle map (Schaefer et al.), `w_i = 1/\|p_i−v\|^{2α}` | move-a-few-handles warp |

### 7.3 `<x:warp>` — generic front-end [implemented: presets + perspective]

Wrap arbitrary child geometry (shapes, `<path>`, outlined text) and apply a field non-destructively;
the children stay editable in the source, the compiler emits the baked `<path>`s inside a `<g>`
carrying the element's paint and `transform` (affine, so it composes after the bake for free).

```xml
<x:warp field="flag" bend="60">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="240" height="80" fill="#14532d"/>
  <x:textbox x="0" y="0" width="240" height="80" align="center" valign="middle" outline="true">WAVING</x:textbox>
</x:warp>
```

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `field` | all 15 Make-with-Warp presets — `arc` \| `arc-lower` \| `arc-upper` \| `arch` \| `bulge` \| `shell-lower` \| `shell-upper` \| `flag` \| `wave` \| `fish` \| `rise` \| `fisheye` \| `inflate` \| `squeeze` \| `twist` — plus `perspective` \| `free` \| `bend` \| `roughen` | — | selects the field |
| `bend` | number, −100…100 (%) | `0` | preset strength; clamped; for displacement presets positive bows **up** (`axis="h"`) / **right** (`axis="v"`) |
| `axis` | `h` \| `v` | `h` | the bend axis (Illustrator's Horizontal/Vertical); applies to the displacement family and `squeeze` — the radial/rotational presets are symmetric and ignore it |
| `corners` | 8 numbers `"x0,y0 x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3"` | — | the target corners — **TL TR BR BL** — for `perspective` / `free`; required by both |
| `distort-h`, `distort-v` | number, −100…100 (%) | `0` | Illustrator's Distortion sliders: a projective **taper composed after** the field |
| `in` | `#id` | — | the spine path for `bend`; required by it (like `<x:textpath in>`, only its geometry is used; an `x:` target resolves to its compiled output — §4) |
| `align`, `start` | as §6.13 | `start`, `0` | place the `bend` envelope along the spine's arc length |
| `detail` | number > 0 | `10` | `roughen` ridge frequency — ridges per 100 user units |

**Model (normative).** Children first lower to pure `<path>` geometry: basic shapes convert (sharp
`<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, and `<path>` as-is); xsvg text elements
participate through their **outlined** form (`outline="true"`, §6.12; `<x:textpath>` output); nested
`<x:warp>`s bake **innermost-first**. The **pre-warp union bbox** of that geometry is the envelope
frame: it normalizes points to `(u, v) ∈ [−1, 1]²` (`u` along the bend axis) and sets the amplitude
**`A = bend · L/4`** (`L` = the frame's bend-axis extent), so a preset scales with the art it warps.
The **displacement** profiles: **arch** `Δ = A(1−u²)` · **flag** `Δ = A·sin(πu)` · **rise** `Δ = A·u`
· **wave** `Δ = A·sin(πu − (π/4)(v+1))`. The **2-D families** evaluate over the whole frame, with
`r̂ = √((nx²+ny²)/2)` the corner-normalized radius (1 at the corners, so **corners stay pinned**):
**fisheye** radial magnify `s = 1 + b(1−r̂²)²` (negative bend = pincushion) · **inflate** per-axis
bulge `sx = 1+(b/2)(1−ny²)`, `sy = 1+(b/2)(1−nx²)` · **squeeze** waist pinch
`u′ = u·(1−(b/2)(1−v²))` (negative = barrel) · **twist** angle-true swirl `θ = b·(π/2)·(1−r̂²)²`.
The fisheye/twist profiles are **eased** (squared, so the gradient also vanishes at the pinned
corners): the fields are fold-free at every bend — outlines never self-cross into corner slivers.
The **scale family** rescales the cross-axis coordinate by a profile of `u` about an anchor:
**bulge** `v′ = v·s`, `s = 1+(b/2)(1−u²)` (midline) · **arc-lower / arc-upper** pin one edge and
apply the same `s` from it (the free edge arcs at its center) · **shell-lower / shell-upper** pin
one edge with the *inverted* profile `s = 1+(b/2)u²` (the free edge's corners flare, its center
stays) · **fish** `v′ = v·s`, `s = 1+(b/2)(1−u²−(1+u)²/4)` (neutral nose, bulged body, tail pinched
to `1−b/2`). **Arc** is the one polar field: the box bends into an annular sector spanning
`Θ = bend·π` (a semicircle at 100%) — the midline becomes an arc of radius `R = L/Θ` (its length is
preserved), perpendicular lines become radii, and the envelope relocates (no pinned corners).
Every path then runs the §7.1 bake at the profile tolerance.

**Spine and noise fields.** `field="bend"` (Inkscape's *LPE Bend*) flows the children along a
referenced spine: the envelope's bend-axis extent maps to arc length (placed by `align`/`start`,
exactly the §6.13 semantics), and its cross axis to a normal offset — the envelope's vertical
midline rides the spine; past either end the spine extends straight. It is the §6.13.2 path-follow
field generalized to arbitrary geometry. `field="roughen"` (Illustrator Effect ▸ Roughen) jitters
every outline point by smooth 2-D value noise: amplitude `|bend| · min(hw, hh)/4` at 100%,
wavelength `100/detail`. The noise lattice is **seeded deterministically** — the same input always
compiles to the same output (§4).

**Corner-driven fields.** `field="perspective"` solves the **8-DOF homography** taking the envelope
frame's corners to the authored `corners` (a Gauss-eliminated DLT over the normalized frame;
precomputed once). Straight lines stay straight — and because the bake's error metric is distance to
the mapped **chord segment**, already-straight output is *not* subdivided. A singular corner
configuration (e.g. collinear targets) degrades like an unknown field. Near the map's horizon line
the denominator is clamped, so extreme quads stay bounded (§4). `field="free"` is the cheaper
4-corner **bilinear blend** (AI Free Distort): edges shear rather than converge, no straightness
promise. **`distort-h` / `distort-v`** compose a center-anchored projective taper *after* any field:
offsets from the frame center divide by `w = 1 − (dh/2)·nx − (dv/2)·ny` (clamped away from zero) —
positive `distort-h` grows the right side, positive `distort-v` the bottom.

**Degradation (normative).** A child that cannot become path geometry (live `<text>`, rounded
`<rect>`, `<line>`, `<image>`, `<use>`) is **skipped with a marker comment** — a warp MUST NOT
silently emit unwarped content. An unknown or absent `field`, or no usable geometry, emits the
children **unwarped behind a marker**. A path that fails to bake keeps its original geometry, and
non-finite coordinates never reach the output (§4).

**v1 limits.** A `<g>` child whose subtree still contains non-path geometry is skipped whole; text
must be outlined to participate.

### 7.4 `<x:boolean>` — live path algebra [implemented: v1]

Pathfinder-style boolean operations over filled regions ([Plan.md §2.5](Plan.md): a *cross-cutting*
capability). The children stay editable in the source; the compiler emits the combined region as
one plain `<path>`.

```xml
<x:boolean op="subtract" fill="#1d4ed8">
  <rect x="40" y="40" width="280" height="90"/>
  <x:textbox x="40" y="40" width="280" height="90" align="center" valign="middle"
             outline="true">PUNCH</x:textbox>
</x:boolean>
```

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `op` | `union` \| `intersect` \| `subtract` \| `exclude` | `union` | the operation; `exclude` = XOR |
| paint attrs | `fill`, `stroke*`, `opacity`, `transform`, … | — | the **result's** paint — per-child paint is ignored (a boolean yields one region) |

**Model (normative).** Each element child is one **operand**, lowered to path geometry exactly like
`<x:warp>` children (§7.3): basic shapes convert, text participates through its outlined form,
nested `x:` elements compose (a boolean can wrap a warp and vice versa). Each operand is resolved
as a region under **its own `fill-rule`** (default `nonzero`) — this also resolves
self-intersections — then the op folds over the operands: `union` / `intersect` / `exclude` are
symmetric; **`subtract` removes every later operand from the first** (document order is
back-to-front, so this is Illustrator's *Minus Front*). Operands **flatten at the profile
tolerance** (the §7.1 graded-approximation contract); the ops themselves are **integer-exact and
deterministic**. The result's contours carry deterministic opposite windings for holes, so it
renders identically under either fill rule.

**Operands by reference (normative).** A `<use href="#id">` child is an operand that **borrows**
the target's geometry per §4 *Reference resolution* (a plain shape's source geometry; a group's
descendants; an `x:` element's compiled output) **without consuming it** — the target keeps
rendering wherever it is. This is the derived-shape form: a venn lens over circles that still draw
themselves, a plate punched by a union that is also its own artwork. The `<use>` element's own
`transform` and its `x`/`y` offset both apply (composed in SVG's order), so one motif can be
stamped at several placements and fused. The operand's `fill-rule` is read from the `<use>`
element itself; legacy `xlink:href` is accepted. A `<use>` that cannot resolve is skipped with a
marker naming the reason (§4). (Everywhere outside `<x:boolean>`, `<use>` remains an untouched
live SVG reference — §5.)

> **Binding time (normative).** This `<use>` is resolved **at compile time** — it borrows a
> snapshot of the target's geometry, unlike SVG's own `<use>`, which is a *live* clone the browser
> keeps in sync. CSS/SMIL animation, script mutation, or any later change to the target does **not**
> update geometry derived from it; re-compile to re-derive. The same holds for every `in="#id"`
> reference (§4).

**Degradation (normative).** A child that cannot become path geometry is skipped with a marker —
never silently dropped from the algebra. An unknown `op` emits the children **un-combined behind a
marker**. A legitimately **empty result** (e.g. a disjoint `intersect`) emits an empty `<g>`; an
element with no usable geometry at all emits only a marker. Plain viewers skip the subtree (§3).

**Stroke expansion.** A plain-shape operand's **stroke ink joins its region** (Illustrator
expands strokes before Pathfinder): the stroke is converted to fill geometry via kurbo's
stroke-to-fill, honoring `stroke-width`, `stroke-linecap`, `stroke-linejoin`, and
**`stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset`**. An **evenodd** operand pre-resolves its fill
(evenodd) ∪ stroke (nonzero) through a nested union so the mixed fill rules never meet. Limit:
`<use>`/nested-`x:` operands stay geometry-only.

**v1 limits.** No multi-output Pathfinder modes (Divide/Trim/Merge).
Backend: [`i_overlay`](https://crates.io/crates/i_overlay) behind a swappable seam (curve-exact
and kurbo-native backends can slot in later without surface changes).

### 7.5 Remaining pillars & deferred [planned]

- **Pillar 3 — paint & pixels.** Pixel adjustments (§8) and **`<x:mesh>` mesh gradients with
  cracks and feathering (§8.2) shipped**. Remaining: smooth-interior T-junctions, `.qmesh`
  import from the vtracer pipeline.
- **Deferred** (valuable, but no longer a headline pillar): **`<x:vstroke>`** variable-width strokes
  (research retained in [Research.md §1](Research.md)).

### 7.6 Connectors — routed lines between elements [implemented]

A `<x:connector from="#a" to="#b">` is a line bound to two elements — the diagramming primitive
Google Draw has and SVG lacks. It resolves each endpoint to a **bounding box** (any referenceable
element per §4 — a shape, a group, or an `x:` element's compiled output), computes a route, and
lowers to a plain `<path>` carrying the connector's own stroke.

```xml
<rect id="a" .../> <rect id="b" .../>
<x:connector from="#a" to="#b" route="x-major" arrow="end" stroke="#475569" stroke-width="2"/>
```

| Attribute | Values | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `route` | `straight` *(default)* | direct line, endpoints clipped to each box's edge along the center-to-center ray |
| | `x-major` | orthogonal rail, **horizontal-first** — exits the facing side, elbows at the horizontal midpoint (H–V–H) |
| | `y-major` | orthogonal rail, **vertical-first** — exits top/bottom, elbows at the vertical midpoint (V–H–V) |
| | `curve` | a cubic with tangents along the dominant axis (horizontal when the boxes are side-by-side, vertical when stacked) |
| `arrow` | `end` *(default)* / `start` / `both` / `none` | a filled triangle (tinted to the stroke) at the chosen ends |
| `arrow-size` | length (default `max(3.5·stroke-width, 7)`) | the arrowhead height |

**Baked reference (normative).** The route is recomputed from the endpoints' boxes, so a connector
is a compile-time reference like `in="#id"`: moving or resizing an endpoint re-emits the connector
(the incremental `dependents` scan covers both `from` and `to` — [Incremental.md](Incremental.md)).
A missing or non-geometry endpoint degrades with a marker (§3).

The arrowhead is a **computed triangle**, not an SVG `<marker>`: its tip sits exactly on the
endpoint (no overshoot into the box) and its size is a plain attribute (`arrow-size`). The base
midpoint is found by walking **the actual route back from the tip until the straight-line (chord)
distance equals `arrow-size`** — for a curve that point lies *on the curve*, so the triangle's base
sits on the stroke and its axis matches the visible exit angle (not the control-handle tangent).
The drawn line is then **trimmed to that base** (the cubic is split with de Casteljau; straight and
orthogonal segments are shortened by `arrow-size`), so the stroke never protrudes past the sharp
tip regardless of its width.

## 8. Pixel adjustments — CSS filter functions [implemented]

The first slice of Pillar 3 (*paint & pixels* — capability catalog: [Paint.md](Paint.md)). The
author writes the **standard `filter` attribute with CSS function syntax** — the form browsers
already render live, so an uncompiled document degrades perfectly (§3) — and the compiler lowers
it to an equivalent **`<filter>` element graph** so the static subset (§9) gets the same pixels.

```xml
<use href="#photo" filter="brightness(1.1) contrast(1.2) -x-curve(0 0, .3 .15, .7 .9, 1 1)"/>
```

**Vocabulary.** `brightness()`, `contrast()`, `saturate()`, `grayscale()`, `sepia()`,
`invert()`, `opacity()` (number or percentage; the 0–1 family clamps like CSS), `hue-rotate()`
(degrees), **`blur(r)`** and **`drop-shadow(dx dy [r] [#color])`** (user units; these two *bleed* — on a
plain shape the `<filter>` region is computed **exactly** as a `userSpaceOnUse` box grown by 3σ
per blur, the shadow offset, and half the stroke width; on unmeasurable content such as groups it
falls back to ±50% of the bbox), the xsvg extension
**`-x-levels(black white [gamma])`** (Photoshop *Levels*: remap the input range, then gamma),
plus **`-x-curve(x0 y0, x1 y1, …)`** — a Photoshop-style tone curve
through control points in [0, 1]² (≥ 2 points, x strictly increasing), interpolated
**monotone-cubically** (no overshoot) and sampled into a `feComponentTransfer` lookup table.
`-x-curve-r/-g/-b/-a` target a single channel. Like other `-x-` vocabulary (§6's
`-x-google-…` fonts), an unsupporting browser ignores the whole declaration and renders the
element unfiltered — degradation, not breakage.

**Lowering (normative).** Each filtered element gets its own `<filter>` definition emitted
immediately before it (self-contained per fragment — [Incremental.md](Incremental.md)), with:
`color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"` (the CSS shorthands are specified in sRGB; SVG's linearRGB
default is the classic mismatch bug), a region of −10 % / 120 % (so strokes outside the fill bbox
survive; the v1 vocabulary is pointwise, so nothing bleeds further), one primitive per function
**in authored order**, and the numeric mappings the Filter Effects spec defines for each shorthand
— lowered output matches live browser rendering. The element's `filter` attribute is rewritten to
`url(#…)`.

**What passes through untouched:** `filter="url(#…)"` references, `none`, and any list the parser
declines — an unknown function or an invalid argument — mirroring CSS's
whole-declaration-invalid rule; browsers still honor those live.

### 8.2 Mesh gradients — `<x:mesh>` [implemented: v1]

The Pillar 3 headline: **corner colors on a quad-dominant mesh**, the representation SVG never got
(SVG 2's `<meshgradient>` was dropped by every browser). Engine: the workspace `gradient` crate
(extracted from vtracer's quadmesh/gradient work).

```xml
<x:mesh points="0,0 120,0 240,10  0,90 120,80 240,100">
  <x:face v="0 1 4 3" fill="#e11 #fa0 #3b7 #06c"/>
  <x:face v="1 2 5 4" fill="#fa0 #ff5 #09f #3b7"/>
  <x:face v="3 4 5"   fill="#06c #3b7 #09f"/>
</x:mesh>
```

**Model (normative).** The `points` attribute holds the shared vertices in SVG's own
`<polygon points>` syntax (`x,y` pairs, comma or whitespace separated); each `<x:face v="…">` names 3 or 4 CCW vertex indices and the same number
of corner colors in `fill` (`#rgb`/`#rrggbb`, or with **alpha** as `#rgba`/`#rrggbbaa` — per-corner
transparency is **feathering**; one color replicates to all corners). Quad corners
map to local `(u,v)` as `0→(0,0) 1→(1,0) 2→(1,1) 3→(0,1)`; color interpolates bilinearly
(inverse-bilinear for non-rectangular quads), barycentrically for triangles, in **linear-light
RGB**. An edge shared by two faces is **smooth** iff both agree on the color *and alpha* at each shared
endpoint — a mismatch is a **crack**, a hard discontinuity; a *region* is a maximal set of faces
connected through smooth edges. Cracks need no extra markup: they fall out of the colors.

**Grid sugar.** The smooth common case needs no indices: `<x:mesh x y width height cols rows
fill="…"/>` lays a `cols×rows`-cell grid over the box, with `fill` holding the
`(cols+1)·(rows+1)` **vertex** colors row-major — per-vertex colors are smooth by construction
(one region), and the form desugars to exactly the indexed mesh (pinned by test). Cracks and
irregular geometry use the indexed form. A malformed grid (wrong color count, `cols`/`rows`
outside 1..64, non-positive extent) degrades with a marker.

**Lowering (normative): render → refit.** (1) The mesh is rasterized in memory at a
profile-graded resolution (fast/balanced/highest → 64/128/384 px across the long axis, and at
least 24/32/48 px across the short one), in linear-light, with per-pixel region labels. (2) Each region is refit with a **seam-free
shared-vertex grid field** — one global least squares per region, grown (up to 10/24/48 per axis
by profile) until the sRGB residual passes the profile tolerance (4/1.5/0.5 RMSE), with the
grid's aspect set by the **field's measured directional variation** (Σ|∂/∂x| vs Σ|∂/∂y|), so a
wide region with vertical structure spends its texels on rows instead of stretching a coarse
column grid — and serialized as a **tiny PNG** (`(gx+1)×(gy+1)` texels, often 2×2, ~40 bytes base64)
placed so its **texel centers land exactly on the grid vertices**: the image spans `n·s/(n−1)` of
the region's bbox span `s`, offset by half a texel-interval — the renderer's own smooth bilinear
image filter then interpolates the exact tensor-product basis of the fitted field. Fitting happens
in the encoded (sRGB) domain because that is the space image samplers interpolate in. Each region
is clipped by the **exact union of its face polygons** (nonzero), so cracks stay geometry-sharp at
any zoom; a region whose fit collapses to a constant emits a plain `<path fill>` (with `fill-opacity` when
translucent). **Feathering**: alpha is a fourth fitted channel — a region carrying any
transparency serializes an **RGBA** PNG (fully opaque regions stay RGB), so soft fades ride the
same texel-aligned reconstruction. Degradations (bad indices, color-count mismatch, degenerate
extent) skip with markers (§3).

**T-junctions** are supported on cracks (each side clips independently) **and inside smooth
regions**: a hanging node whose color+alpha matches the coarse edge's interpolation at that point
joins the faces into one region (a mismatch is a crack, as always).

**v1 limits.** `image-rendering` must remain default (smooth) for the reconstruction to hold;
alpha interpolates in straight (unpremultiplied) form — a steep alpha cliff against a strongly
different color can fringe slightly at extreme zoom (measured to be the *better* side of the
trade: fitting premultiplied loses at every grid size — [Bench.md](Bench.md) §2).

#### SVG 2 / Inkscape `<meshgradient>` compatibility [implemented: v1]

Inkscape is the only major tool that *authors* SVG 2 mesh gradients, and no browser renders them —
xsvg compiles them. A shape whose `fill` references a `<meshgradient>` lowers through the same
pipeline: each Coons patch (four cubic edges, four corner colors) **tessellates into the
straight-quad mesh** (polycurve → points, at a profile-graded density of 8/12/20 cells per patch
axis), the shape's geometry becomes the clip, and the stroke (if any) re-emits on top. Dialect
coverage: `meshrow`/`meshpatch`/`stop` with one `c`/`C`/`l`/`L` edge per stop, `stop-color` as an
attribute or inside `style` (hex, alpha forms included) with **`stop-opacity`** honored
(feathering), the standard edge/corner **inheritance** (a patch after the
first inherits its left edge reversed from its neighbour, later rows inherit top edges from
above), `gradientTransform`, **`gradientUnits="objectBoundingBox"`** (patch coordinates in the
shape's unit bbox), and **`type="bicubic"`** — approximated by smoothstep-easing `(u, v)` inside
each patch, which zeroes the tangential derivative at every patch boundary so adjacent patches
meet C¹ and the bilinear Mach bands at seams disappear. Adjacent patches join smoothly by
construction (shared edges tessellate to shared vertices with matching colors). The reference is
**compile-time baked**, so the incremental `dependents` scan treats `fill="url(#mesh)"` like an
`in=` edge. An unparseable dialect leaves the element as authored with a marker (unrendered live,
exactly as in a browser).

## 9. Lowering target [implemented]

Output is the **static SVG subset** (resvg's scope): no script, animation, events, or `meshgradient`.
Text lowers to `<text>`/`<tspan>` in v0 (browser-shaped), or to outlined `<path>` on demand (§6.12).
Enforced by the §5 deny list (script/animation elements drop with markers; `on*` attributes strip).

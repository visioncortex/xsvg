## 1. Overview

xsvg is an XML interchange format — a **graceful-degradation superset of SVG** — that a compiler
lowers to a **static SVG subset** renderable in any SVG engine. The win should cost one tag-swap or
one attribute, and nothing added can break the file. Design rationale is in [Syntax.md](Syntax.md).

## 2. Namespaces & the prefix policy [implemented]

| Namespace | URI |
|---|---|
| SVG | `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` |
| xsvg extensions | `https://xsvg.visioncortex.org` (conventional prefix `x:`) |

The document root MAY be `<svg>` (with `xmlns:x` declared) or `<xsvg>` (an alias the compiler treats
as `<svg>`). Naming rules:

| Kind | Rule |
|---|---|
| A name SVG/CSS already defines | use it **unprefixed**, with SVG/CSS semantics (`inline-size`, `text-align`, `<textArea>`, `text-overflow`) |
| A new attribute on a standard element | **`x:`-prefixed** (`x:fit`, `x:width-profile`) |
| A new element | **`x:`-prefixed** (`<x:textbox>`, `<x:vstroke>`, `<x:mesh>`, `<x:boolean>`) |
| Attributes inside an `x:` element | **unprefixed** (the element disambiguates) |

## 3. Degradation contract [implemented]

| Input | Plain SVG viewer | xsvg compiler |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown attribute on a known element | ignores it (element still renders) | applies it |
| Unknown element (`x:` or a revived-but-unsupported SVG element like `<textArea>`) | skips it (content not rendered) | lowers it to the SVG subset |
| Everything else | renders normally | passes through |

A document MUST remain well-formed SVG/XML; the compiler MUST NOT require anything a plain SVG viewer
would reject.

## 4. Processing model [implemented]

```
parse → resolve → lower (quality-parameterized) → emit SVG subset
```

Lowering that needs **font metrics** obtains them through a host-supplied *measurer*: a function
returning, for a string at a size, its advance width and the font's vertical metrics
(`ascent`, `descent`, `cap_height`, `x_height`). In v0 the browser supplies this via canvas
`measureText`; defaults approximate `ascent 0.8em, descent 0.2em, cap_height 0.7em, x_height 0.5em`.
Architecture: [Plan.md §1](Plan.md).

Shape geometry for region flow (§6.10) is obtained through a parallel *shaper* seam: it rasterizes a
filled path into coarse per-row inside-spans. In v0 the browser supplies it (`getBBox` +
`isPointInFill`); a pure-Rust backend can slot in behind the same trait later.

**Robustness (normative).** Compilation is total on well-formed input: degenerate geometry
(zero/negative width, height, padding, or `font-size`), degenerate spacing (negative
`letter-spacing`/`word-spacing`), and pathological measurer output (non-finite or negative advances)
must never panic and must never emit `NaN`/`inf` coordinates — they collapse to empty or zero-sized
output instead. **Element nesting is bounded** at a fixed depth (v0: 512); deeper input is rejected
with an error rather than risking a parser stack overflow. Malformed XML returns an error.

## 5. Graphics elements (reused SVG) [implemented]

`<g>`, `<path>`, basic shapes, gradients, `transform`, `fill`/`stroke` are normalized or passed
through. Defined lowerings:

- **`<rect>`** with no `rx`/`ry` → `<path>`; rounded rects pass through unchanged.

## 6. Text

### 6.1 Common layout primitives [implemented]

- **Measurement.** Words are measured once at the base size; trial sizes scale widths linearly.
- **Wrapping.** Greedy (first-fit): break only at whitespace. A token wider than the available width
  is placed alone (it overflows; see §6.6). No automatic hyphenation in v0.
- **Fitting** (shrink-to-fit, `<x:textbox>` only). Binary-search the font size in
  `[fit-min, font-size]` for the largest whose wrapped block fits the box height; re-wrap each trial.

### 6.2 `<text>` and `inline-size` — Rung 1 [implemented]

Point `<text>` passes through. With **`inline-size="W"`**, the text wraps to width `W` and flows
downward; the **first line's baseline is at `y`** (the SVG `<text>` convention), and subsequent
baselines step by `line-height · font-size` (default `line-height` = 1.2). Horizontal alignment uses
the inherited `text-anchor`.

### 6.3 `<textArea>` — Rung 2, SVG Tiny 1.2 subset [implemented]

Flowed text in a region, per the SVG Tiny 1.2 Recommendation.

| Property / attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x`, `y` | length | 0 | region corner |
| `width`, `height` | length \| `auto` | `auto` | `width:auto` ⇒ no wrap; `height:auto` ⇒ grow (no clip) |
| `text-align` | `start` \| `end` \| `center` \| `justify` | `start` | inline alignment (`justify` extends Tiny 1.2 — §6.9) |
| `display-align` | `auto` \| `before` \| `center` \| `after` | `auto` (= `before`) | block alignment |
| `line-increment` | `auto` \| `<number>` | `auto` | line-box height; `auto` = 1.1 × font-size |

**Layout.** Wrap to the width (or not, if `auto`). Baselines **step by `line-increment`** (the SVG Tiny
1.2 line-box height). `display-align` then positions the **cap-height ink band** (§6.5) —
`before`=cap-top at the top edge, `center`=band centred, `after`=band bottom at the bottom edge — so
centred text is optically centred, not biased low by the em box. With an explicit `height`, lines whose
ink band falls outside the region are **not rendered** (clipped; see §6.6).

**`<tbreak/>`** [implemented] — a forced line break, per SVG Tiny 1.2. Each `<tbreak/>` child ends the
current line and starts a new one; wrapping resumes independently on each side. Consecutive breaks
produce blank lines. This is the only child element `<textArea>` interprets in v0.

**Not yet implemented:** `xml:space="preserve"`, full UAX #14 line-breaking (we break on
whitespace), `editable`.

### 6.4 `<x:textbox>` — Rung 3, xsvg box [implemented]

Box text with diagram ergonomics. Shares `<textArea>`'s cap-height vertical model, differing in line
spacing (`line-height` vs `line-increment`) and keyword (`valign` vs `display-align`); see §6.5.

| Attr | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x`,`y`,`width`,`height` | length | — | box geometry (ignored when `in` is set) |
| `in` | `#id` | — | bind to a referenced shape (§6.10) |
| `padding` | length | 0 | uniform content inset |
| `align` | `start` \| `center` \| `end` \| `justify` | `start` | horizontal alignment (§6.9) |
| `valign` | `top` \| `middle` \| `bottom` | `top` | vertical alignment |
| `fit` | `none` \| `shrink` | `none` | shrink-to-fit (§6.1) |
| `fit-min` | length | 6 | font-size floor for `shrink` |
| `line-height` | number | 1.2 | line advance multiplier |

### 6.5 Vertical alignment model (normative) [implemented]

Both box elements align on the **cap-height band** — the region from the first line's **cap-top** to
the last line's **baseline + descent** — positioning it optically rather than centring the em box
(which would sit low, since ascent > cap-height). They differ only in **line spacing** and the
keyword: `<textArea>` steps by `line-increment` and takes `display-align` (`before`/`center`/`after`);
`<x:textbox>` steps by `line-height · font-size` and takes `valign` (`top`/`middle`/`bottom`).

**Baseline-stability invariant (both):** alignment reserves the *font's* descent (a constant), not
the per-string ink. Therefore a descender-free and a descender-bearing label in the same box land on
the **same baseline** — descenders fill the reserved descent rather than shifting the text. This MUST
hold for every alignment.

### 6.6 Overflow & truncation — `text-overflow` [implemented]

Applies to box-bound text (`<textArea>`, `<x:textbox>`); not to point text or `inline-size` flow.

- **`text-overflow`** : `clip` *(initial)* | `ellipsis`. Unprefixed (CSS/SVG 2 name). `clip` is the
  default and reproduces SVG Tiny 1.2 behavior.

**Overflow axes.** *Block:* more wrapped lines than fit the content height. *Inline:* a line wider
than the content width (an unbreakable token).

**Order.** Resolve font size (apply `fit` first) → wrap → compute the fitting line count `C` (lines
whose box lies within the height; `C` = all if height is `auto`) → apply `text-overflow`:

- **`clip`** — render lines `0 … C−1`; drop the rest. Inline overflow renders past the box (a clip
  path MAY be emitted at higher quality).
- **`ellipsis`** — render `0 … C−1`; if lines were dropped, the **last rendered line** is ellipsized;
  any rendered line wider than the content width is ellipsized. If `C = 0`, render nothing.

**Fit vs. truncate (not contradictory — sequential).** `fit` and truncation answer two different
questions: *should the font adapt to the box?* and *what becomes of whatever still overflows?*
`fit="shrink"` reduces *how much* overflows by shrinking the font, but only down to the `fit-min`
legibility floor; `text-overflow` then handles the residual at that floor. So truncation fires
**only when fit bottoms out at `fit-min` and the text still doesn't fit** — with no floor (or a
generous one) fit wins and nothing is truncated; with no `fit`, `text-overflow` acts at the authored
size. `text-overflow` is a single, general overflow control, independent of fitting.

**Ellipsizing a line** (`line`, `max_width`, marker `E` = `…` U+2026):
1. If `width(E) > max_width`, render nothing.
2. Strip trailing whitespace, then trim trailing **characters** until `width(line + E) ≤ max_width`
   (re-stripping exposed whitespace), so the result reads `word…` not `word …`.
3. If `line` is emptied, render just `E`.
4. Emit `line + E`.

Trimming is by character (CSS-like). v0 truncates at the **inline end** only; the marker is a single
`…` glyph. A future `x:ellipsis` MAY allow a custom marker.

| Edge case | Result |
|---|---|
| empty / whitespace-only | nothing |
| box too short for one line (`C=0`) | nothing |
| box narrower than `…` | nothing |
| text fits | no marker (== `clip`) |
| line trims to empty before `…` fits | just `…` |

**Differs from CSS/SVG 2:** one property covers **both** block (multi-line, like `-webkit-line-clamp`)
and inline overflow; implemented by emitting `<tspan>`s, so it renders without SVG-2 support.

### 6.7 Glyph width scaling — `x:glyph-x-scale` [implemented]

A purely **visual** horizontal scale on rendered glyphs. Applies to all three text front-ends:
unprefixed `glyph-x-scale` on `<x:textbox>`; `x:`-prefixed `x:glyph-x-scale` on plain-SVG `<text
inline-size>` and `<textArea>` (the prefix policy of §3 — a new attribute on a reused SVG element is
namespaced).

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `glyph-x-scale` | `<number>` | `1` | multiply each line's advance width by this factor |

**Lowering.** Per emitted line, the compiler measures the natural advance `w`, then emits
`textLength="w · scale" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"` on the `<tspan>`. Renderers stretch/compress
the glyphs and inter-glyph spacing to hit that length. **Layout is unchanged** — wrapping, fitting and
overflow all run at the natural width; only the final rendered glyphs are scaled. A value of `1` (the
initial) emits nothing. Empty lines are left untouched. When combined with `letter-spacing` (§6.8),
the `textLength` target is computed from the letter-spaced advance so the two compose.

### 6.8 Letter & word spacing — `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing` [implemented]

CSS/SVG tracking: uniform extra space between grapheme clusters (`letter-spacing`) and at each
inter-word gap (`word-spacing`), on every text element (unprefixed — both are existing SVG/CSS
names, §3).

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `letter-spacing` | `normal` \| `<length>` | `normal` (= 0) | extra advance added per inter-grapheme gap |
| `word-spacing` | `normal` \| `<length>` | `normal` (= 0) | extra advance added per inter-word space |

**Model (normative).** Both are **absolute lengths** in user units — they do *not* scale with
`font-size` (so under shrink-to-fit the spacing stays put while glyphs shrink), matching CSS/SVG. They
are **additive on top of kerning**, not a replacement: the font's pair kerning stays in the glyph
advances (whatever the measurer models — real for canvas, none for the test fixtures) and the spacing
is layered over it. The rendered advance of a run of *n* grapheme clusters containing *s* inter-word
spaces is:

```
advance = kerned_advance(run) + (n − 1) × letter-spacing + s × word-spacing
```

**Layout-aware.** This spaced advance — not the raw glyph advance — drives wrapping, shrink-to-fit,
ellipsis truncation and alignment, so tracked text breaks and fits correctly. The attributes are then
emitted on the output `<text>` (or forwarded on a passed-through `<text inline-size>`); the renderer
reproduces exactly the width layout assumed. `normal` and `0` emit nothing. Counts use code points in
v0 (grapheme-cluster segmentation is a future refinement; wrapped lines join words with a single
space, so the inter-word count is exact); `font-kerning` is left at the renderer default (`normal`).

### 6.9 Justification — `text-align="justify"` / `align="justify"` [implemented]

Full-justify on the box front-ends (`<textArea>` via `text-align`, `<x:textbox>` via `align`). The
value `justify` extends the SVG Tiny 1.2 `text-align` vocabulary with the CSS/SVG 2 value (§3).

**Model (normative).** After wrapping, a line is **justified** — stretched to the content width — iff
**all** of:
- alignment is `justify` and the box has a **positive, known content width** (auto-width `<textArea>`
  has no target, so it degrades to `start`);
- it is **not** the last line of its paragraph (the last line, and the last line before each
  `<tbreak/>`, stay ragged — normal typographic convention);
- it contains **more than one word** (a lone word has nothing to stretch between).

An ellipsized line (§6.6) is never justified. Justified lines anchor at the **start** edge.

**Lowering.** A justified line emits `textLength="<content-width>" lengthAdjust="spacing"` on its
`<tspan>`; the renderer distributes the slack into the inter-glyph/word spacing (glyph shapes are not
scaled — contrast `glyph-x-scale`, §6.7, which uses `spacingAndGlyphs`). On a line that would carry
both, justification wins. v0 distributes slack uniformly across all gaps (not word-gaps-only); a
word-spacing-only composer is a future refinement.

### 6.10 Shape binding & region flow — `<x:textbox in="#id">` [implemented]

Binds a textbox to a referenced shape instead of its own `x/y/width/height`.

- **`in="#id"`** resolves to any element in the document. A missing target renders nothing (a comment
  marker is emitted).
- If the target is a **`rect`**, the textbox uses its box and the rectangular model of §6.4/§6.5 —
  `fit`, `valign`, `padding`, `align` all apply. This is the common "label a box" case.
- **Any other fillable shape** (`path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `polygon`, `polyline`) → text is flowed
  **inside the actual filled outline** (the Vision's *fit-text-in-polygon*): each line is wrapped to
  the shape's inside width *at that height*, so a triangle's lines shorten toward its apex and a
  circle's bulge across the middle.

**Geometry seam (normative architecture).** Region geometry is obtained through a host-supplied
*shaper* — the geometric analog of the *measurer* (§4). The shaper rasterizes a filled path into a
coarse table of per-row inside-spans `[left, right]`; the pure layout then flows text into that table
(intersecting spans across each line box so glyphs never cross the outline). In v0 the browser is the
shaper — curve flattening, bounds, and inside-testing are deferred to `getBBox` + `isPointInFill` — and
native tests replay browser-generated raster fixtures. A pure-Rust shaper (flatten + scanline) is a
later backend behind the same seam.

**Alignment.** `align` (`start`/`center`/`end`) positions each line within its own span. `valign`
(`top`/`middle`/`bottom`) positions the flowed block within the region's vertical extent: a first pass
sizes the block, then the flow re-runs from a shifted start (so each line still gets the span at its
final height — a middle-aligned block in a diamond straddles the widest band). The shift clamps to 0
when the block is taller than the region, so it never drops words top-alignment wouldn't.

**v0 scope.** No **shrink-to-fit** in region mode (rect fast-path only). `text-overflow` clips at the
region's bottom and can ellipsize the last line. Vertical resolution is coarse (row height ≈
font-size ⁄ 3). Any outline whose every horizontal slice is a **single run** flows correctly —
including vertical-pinch concavities like an hourglass (lines just narrow at the waist). A row that
splits into **two runs** (a donut, a horizontal bowtie, a `U`) collapses to its outer
`[leftmost, rightmost]` span, so text bridges the gap — v0 has no multi-span rows. A word wider than a
line's span still overflows the outline (the usual lone-word rule) unless `text-overflow="ellipsis"`
trims it.

### 6.11 Styled runs — `<tspan>` [implemented]

Inline styling inside `<textArea>` and `<x:textbox>`: a child `<tspan>` is a **run** whose text
shares the surrounding paragraph but overrides its paint/style. This reuses SVG's own inline-span
element (§3, reuse-unprefixed) — the same `<tspan>` the compiler emits, now also read on input.

| Overridable on a run | Notes |
|---|---|
| `fill` | per-run colour |
| `font-weight`, `font-style` | e.g. bold / italic words |
| `font-family` | per-run typeface |

**Model (normative).** Runs affect a word's **advance** (weight/style/family change glyph widths), so
each word is measured in its own run style and wrapping stays correct; a run boundary may fall
mid-word (two pieces, no break between them). **`font-size` is not overridable in v0** — mixed sizes
would perturb line-height and baseline; runs share the paragraph size, `letter-spacing`, and
`word-spacing`. Nested `<tspan>`s compose (inner wins). `<tbreak/>` still breaks across runs.

**Lowering.** Each output line is one positioning `<tspan x y>` (which also carries any justify /
`glyph-x-scale` `textLength`); within it, base-styled text is emitted bare and each run becomes a
nested `<tspan>` carrying only the attributes that differ from the base `<text>`. So a plain paragraph
emits exactly as before (no nested spans). Ellipsis truncates from the last run inward.

**v0 limits.** Styled runs apply to the rectangular box front-ends (`<textArea>`, `<x:textbox>` — incl.
`in="#rect"`); curved-shape region flow (§6.10) and `<text inline-size>` flatten runs to the base
style. Per-run `stroke` and `font-size` are future work.

### 6.12 Create outlines — `outline="true"` [implemented]

Turn a text element's glyphs into vector `<path>` geometry at compile time ("Create Outlines" in
Illustrator terms). Set `outline="true"` on `<x:textbox>`, or the prefixed `x:outline="true"` on the
reused `<textArea>` (§2). Layout is unchanged — outlining is a purely **emit-time** transform applied
after wrapping, fitting, and alignment have run.

**Model (normative).** Each laid-out line is traced from its text at the element's **base style** and
emitted as a `<path>` inside a single `<g>` that carries the element's paint — `fill` plus any
`stroke*` / `paint-order` (so an outline can be filled, stroked as a keyline, or both). Outlining is
**all-or-nothing per element with graceful fallback**: if the backend cannot outline *every* line
(e.g. the font's bytes are unavailable), the element falls back to live `<text>` unchanged — so an
outline request never breaks a drawing, it only upgrades it when the font is present. Lines are
anchored by their measured width (`text-anchor` start/middle/end resolved to an `x` origin), matching
the live-text placement.

**The seam.** Outlines come from a platform `GlyphOutliner` (parallel to the `Measurer`/`Shaper`
seams of §4): given a run, its style, size, and baseline origin, it returns a path `d` or `None`. The
browser adapter backs it with [opentype.js](https://opentype.js.org) and therefore needs the font's
**bytes** — the host application registers fonts by family (a family with no registered font ⇒ live
`<text>`). Arbitrary installed system fonts are not outlinable this way.

**Fonts by name (reference app).** So a source needn't ship font bytes, the web app resolves a
`font-family="-x-google-<Name>"` marker by fetching that family from Google Fonts once (css2 →
woff2 → decompressed to sfnt by a vendored decoder), then (a) registering it with the outliner and
(b) adding it to the document via `FontFace` so **live `<text>` and canvas metrics** use the real face
too — not only the outlined `<path>`. The marker is stripped to the bare family before compile, so a
resolution failure degrades to the normal live-`<text>` fallback. This is app-level font provisioning,
not part of the interchange format.

**Why.** The drawing then carries the **true display face as geometry** — it renders identically
anywhere, with no font install or `@font-face` embed, at the cost of selectable text (a hidden `<text>`
layer for searchability is future work, §G). This is also the prerequisite for the *text-as-vector-art*
effects of the remaining pillars (§7): geometry warp/envelope and mesh-fill applied to glyph outlines.

**v0 limits.** Outline mode uses the base style per line: per-run styling (§6.11), `justify` (§6.9),
`glyph-x-scale` (§6.7), and `letter-spacing`/`word-spacing` (§6.8) do not apply to the traced path, and
curved-shape region flow (§6.10) keeps its own per-line placement. Per-run outlining is future work.

### 6.13 Text on a path — `<x:textpath>` [implemented: skew, rainbow]

Bind a text run to an open path: the run is laid out on a straight baseline, **outlined** (§6.12), and
its geometry **warped onto the path**. This is a **specialization of the geometry-transform pipeline
(§7)** — the outlined run is the source geometry, and the reference path derives the **field** (§7.2)
that the §7.1 bake applies — and it mirrors Illustrator's *Type on a Path* effects. The `effect`
attribute just **selects the field**: **skew** = the *displacement* field (§6.13.1); **rainbow** =
the *path-follow* field (§6.13.2); **stair** = the displacement field applied **per-glyph** instead
of per-point, on live `<text>` (§6.13.3).

**Surface.**
```xml
<path id="wave" d="M0,40 C60,0 140,80 200,40" fill="none"/>
<x:textpath in="#wave" effect="skew" font-family="-x-google-Anton" font-size="32" fill="#111">rides the wave</x:textpath>
```
- **`in="#id"`** *(required)* — the reference path (an open `<path>` / `<line>` / `<polyline>`). Like
  `<x:textbox in="#shape">` and `clipPath`, only its **geometry** is used; its own paint is ignored.
- **`effect`** — `skew` *(default; §6.13.1)* | `rainbow` *(§6.13.2)* | `stair` *(§6.13.3)* |
  `ribbon` *(§6.13.4)* | `follow` *(§6.13.5)*.
- **`baseline-shift`** — length, default `0`: offsets the run's baseline from the path along the
  **local normal** — positive lifts the text above the path, matching SVG `baseline-shift`
  semantics. Applies to every effect (under skew, where the normal is not computed, it is a plain
  vertical lift). Two runs on the same path with opposite shifts sit above and below it.
- **`align`** — `start` *(default)* | `middle` | `end`: where the run sits within the path's
  **extent** — its x-extent under skew, its **arc length** under rainbow. The slack
  (`extent − run width`) may be negative (a run longer than the path); `middle`/`end` then shift
  before the path's start, symmetric with the past-the-end overshoot.
- **`start`** — an absolute head-start (user units) added after `align`: x units under skew, arc
  length under rainbow (default `0`).
- Standard text attributes apply: `font-*`, `fill`, `stroke*` (the emitted outline carries them, §6.12),
  `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing`.
- **Single line only** — a path is a 1-D track, so `inline-size`/wrapping do not apply; a run longer than
  the path's x-extent is clipped at the end.

**Model (normative).** The run is shaped on a flat baseline (`y = 0`, advancing in `x` from `start`),
producing glyph outlines (§6.12). Let **`f(x)`** be the reference path's **height profile** — its `y`
at horizontal position `x`. The compiler samples `f` from the path; the path **SHOULD be single-valued
in `x`**, and where it is not, the first (topmost) `y` at that `x` is used.

**6.13.1 Skew — 1-D vertical displacement [implemented].** The §7.2 **displacement** field: every outline
point maps

> `(x, y) → (x, y + f(x) − baseline-shift)`

so glyphs stay **upright**, vertical strokes stay vertical, and horizontal edges tilt by the local slope
`f'(x)` — the vertical **shear** Illustrator calls *Skew*. There is **no arc-length reparameterization
and no normal offset**, hence no generic path-offsetting — the cheapest field. It runs through the §7.1
bake unchanged (flatten → displace → refit), emitted as one `<path>` per run inside a
`<g fill=… stroke=…>` (exactly as §6.12); the flatten tolerance is the graded quality knob.

**6.13.2 Rainbow — arc-length follow + deform [implemented].** The §7.2 **path-follow** field:
reparameterize by arc length (text-`x` → distance `s` along the path) and map every outline point

> `(x, y) → P(s) + (y − baseline-shift)·N(s)`,  `s = x`

where `P(s)` is the path point at arc length `s` and **`N(s)` is the unit normal — the tangent rotated
+90° in the y-down coordinate system** (for a left→right path `N` points down, so ascenders rise above
the curve and positive `baseline-shift` lifts the run off it). This both rotates *and* deforms glyphs
along the curve: each point is mapped independently, so strokes compress on the inside of a bend and
stretch on the outside. Unlike skew there is **no single-valued-in-`x` restriction** — loops and
vertical segments are fine. **Beyond either end** of the path the frame extends **straight along the
end tangent**, so a run longer than the path continues rather than bunching at the endpoint. **The
bake is native** (§7.1, in `xsvg-core`): the reference path flattens into an arc-length frame, and
the outlined run — the browser supplies only the glyph geometry and its advance width — runs the
standard pipeline with the quality-graded tolerance and adaptive subdivision. For a
*non-deforming* follow, use `effect="follow"` (§6.13.5).

**6.13.3 Stair Step — per-glyph steps, live text [implemented].** The authorable stepped baseline:
glyphs stay upright and **undeformed**; each is absolutely positioned via per-glyph `x`/`y` lists —
`x` from kerned prefix advances plus the §6.8 spacing gaps (honoring `align`/`start`), `y =
f(x_glyph) − baseline-shift` sampled from the **native height profile**. Because it lowers to live
`<text>` (never the outliner), it **needs no font bytes**, stays selectable, and uses the live
face — the one path effect available everywhere (only the *measurer* is required).

**6.13.4 3D Ribbon — normal-offset heights [implemented].** Skew's complement: the baseline rides
the height profile exactly as §6.13.1, but glyph heights offset along the profile's **normal**
instead of straight up —

> `(x, y) → (x, f(x)) + (y − baseline-shift)·N(x)`

with `N(x)` the profile's unit normal. Vertical strokes tilt perpendicular to the path while
horizontal strokes stay parallel to it — the twisting-ribbon look. Like skew (and unlike rainbow)
there is no arc-length reparameterization; the path is read as a height field, single-valued in `x`.

**How the three warping effects relate** — same skeleton, two independent choices:

| effect | glyph advance measured… | glyph "up" points… | consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| skew | along **x** | straight up | upright letters; x-extent preserved |
| ribbon | along **x** | along the **normal** | letters lean with the slope; x-extent preserved, but glyphs stretch by `√(1+f′²)` along steep sections |
| rainbow | along **arc length** | along the **normal** | letters rotate rigidly, constant width/spacing on any curve; the run consumes arc length, not x |

**6.13.5 Follow — SVG's native `<textPath>` [implemented].** The *non-deforming* follow: lowers to
live `<text><textPath href="#id">`, so glyphs stay undeformed and the text stays **selectable** —
the renderer does the following. `align`/`start` compile to `startOffset` (resolved against the
path's arc length and the measured run width); `baseline-shift` is forwarded as the presentation
attribute. Needs no font bytes; the trade-off is renderer-dependent glyph placement and no §7
warping — it is the one effect whose output uses `<textPath>` rather than baked geometry.

**Degradation [implemented].** The warping effects need the glyph outliner (§6.12). If it is
unavailable (no font bytes), the **height-profile effects (skew, ribbon) degrade to the stair-step
lowering** (§6.13.3) — same field, per-glyph instead of per-point. Rainbow, or a run whose height
profile can't be sampled, degrades to a straight `<text>` at the element's `x`/`y` — the document
never breaks.

**v0 limits.** Single line; base style per run (per-run `<tspan>` styling, `justify`, `glyph-x-scale`
do not apply, as §6.12); for skew the path is treated as a height field (single-valued in `x`). The
run width used by `align` matches the geometry being placed: the outline advance for warped runs (no
letter/word-spacing, §6.12), the spacing-inclusive advance for the stepped fallback. The
native-`<textPath>` non-deforming follow is future work.

## 7. Geometry transforms — a generic deformation pipeline [implemented: first slice]

Pillar 2. SVG's `transform` is **affine-only** (`matrix` has an implicit `[0 0 1]` row), so perspective,
warp, and envelope distortions **cannot ride on vector geometry** — xsvg **bakes** them into deformed
paths. The design is deliberately **generic**: one pipeline, a library of pluggable **fields**, and thin
front-ends. Text on a path (§6.13) is *one* front-end; skew / rainbow are *just field functions*.
Grounded in [Research.md §7](Research.md); the capability catalog (Illustrator parity: warp presets,
perspective, envelopes) and build order are in [Transform.md](Transform.md).

### 7.1 The bake (normative) [implemented]

Every geometry transform is the same three steps, parameterized only by a field `D` and a tolerance:

> **flatten → map → refit.** **Flatten** each source path to a polyline within a Hausdorff `tolerance`;
> **map** every vertex through the field `D`; **refit** the mapped polyline to cubic `<path>` segments
> (or emit the polyline directly at low quality).

Bézier curves are affine-invariant, so *affine* `D` may be applied to control points directly — but a
**non-affine `D` must go through flatten→map→refit** (mapping only control points is wrong; error grows
with segment span × field nonlinearity). The **`tolerance` is the graded quality knob**: kurbo's flatten
gives segment count ∝ `tolerance`⁻½, so tightening it trades path size for fidelity. This is the *only*
approximation step; the emitted `<path>` is exact SVG.

**The v1 implementation** (kurbo-backed, in `xsvg-core`, natively tested) runs all three steps.
Chords — including straight source segments and implicit closing edges — are **subdivided
adaptively**: a segment splits while any mapped probe (mid + quarter points) deviates from the
mapped chord *segment* by more than `tolerance` (depth-capped), so long straight edges curve
smoothly under a nonlinear field while line-preserving fields (perspective) emit zero waste. The
**refit** step is implemented at the API level (kurbo's corner-aware simplify, natively tested)
but **disabled in the lowering**: on dense, quantized glyph outlines kurbo 0.13's fitter overshoots
— producing notched edges and hairline slivers — and its optimizing level dominates compile time
(its subdivision level degrades badly on reversed runs). Until a robust fitter lands, **every
profile emits the tolerance-graded polyline** (`M`/`L`/`Z`) at 1.0 / 0.25 / 0.05 user units, which
stays within tolerance of the true mapped geometry by construction.

### 7.2 Deformation fields [skew shipped-first]

A **field** is a pure map `D : ℝ² → ℝ²` (a point in source space → output space); a field may precompute
state (e.g. an arc-length table) but exposes only per-point evaluation to the bake. The catalog — all
interchangeable under §7.1:

| Field | `D(x, y)` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **displacement** *(skew, §6.13.1)* | `(x, y + f(x))` | 1-D vertical shift by a height profile `f`; the cheapest field — no arc-length, no offset. **First to ship.** |
| **path-follow** *(rainbow, §6.13.2)* | `P(s) + y·N(s)`, `s = arclen⁻¹(x)` | follow + normal offset ⇒ glyphs deform; arc-length frame + normal offset. **Shipped, native** (§6.13.2) |
| **envelope preset** | analytic (arc / arch / flag / wave / fisheye / twist …) | Illustrator Envelope-Distort presets over the source bbox. **All 15 shipped** (§7.3); full catalog in [Transform.md §B](Transform.md) |
| **perspective** | homography `((ax+cy+e)/(gx+hy+1), (bx+dy+f)/(gx+hy+1))` | 8-DOF projective; SVG can't express it on vectors. **Shipped** (§7.3, `corners`-solved), plus **free** (bilinear) and the distortion-slider taper |
| **FFD** | trivariate/bivariate Bézier lattice (Sederberg-Parry) | editable cage/grid |
| **MLS** | weighted handle map (Schaefer et al.), `w_i = 1/\|p_i−v\|^{2α}` | move-a-few-handles warp |

### 7.3 `<x:warp>` — generic front-end [implemented: presets + perspective]

Wrap arbitrary child geometry (shapes, `<path>`, outlined text) and apply a field non-destructively;
the children stay editable in the source, the compiler emits the baked `<path>`s inside a `<g>`
carrying the element's paint and `transform` (affine, so it composes after the bake for free).

```xml
<x:warp field="flag" bend="60">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="240" height="80" fill="#14532d"/>
  <x:textbox x="0" y="0" width="240" height="80" align="center" valign="middle" outline="true">WAVING</x:textbox>
</x:warp>
```

| Attr | Values | Initial | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `field` | all 15 Make-with-Warp presets — `arc` \| `arc-lower` \| `arc-upper` \| `arch` \| `bulge` \| `shell-lower` \| `shell-upper` \| `flag` \| `wave` \| `fish` \| `rise` \| `fisheye` \| `inflate` \| `squeeze` \| `twist` — plus `perspective` \| `free` \| `bend` \| `roughen` | — | selects the field |
| `bend` | number, −100…100 (%) | `0` | preset strength; clamped; for displacement presets positive bows **up** (`axis="h"`) / **right** (`axis="v"`) |
| `axis` | `h` \| `v` | `h` | the bend axis (Illustrator's Horizontal/Vertical); applies to the displacement family and `squeeze` — the radial/rotational presets are symmetric and ignore it |
| `corners` | 8 numbers `"x0,y0 x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3"` | — | the target corners — **TL TR BR BL** — for `perspective` / `free`; required by both |
| `distort-h`, `distort-v` | number, −100…100 (%) | `0` | Illustrator's Distortion sliders: a projective **taper composed after** the field |
| `in` | `#id` | — | the spine path for `bend`; required by it (like `<x:textpath in>`, only its geometry is used) |
| `align`, `start` | as §6.13 | `start`, `0` | place the `bend` envelope along the spine's arc length |
| `detail` | number > 0 | `10` | `roughen` ridge frequency — ridges per 100 user units |

**Model (normative).** Children first lower to pure `<path>` geometry: basic shapes convert (sharp
`<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, and `<path>` as-is); xsvg text elements
participate through their **outlined** form (`outline="true"`, §6.12; `<x:textpath>` output); nested
`<x:warp>`s bake **innermost-first**. The **pre-warp union bbox** of that geometry is the envelope
frame: it normalizes points to `(u, v) ∈ [−1, 1]²` (`u` along the bend axis) and sets the amplitude
**`A = bend · L/4`** (`L` = the frame's bend-axis extent), so a preset scales with the art it warps.
The **displacement** profiles: **arch** `Δ = A(1−u²)` · **flag** `Δ = A·sin(πu)` · **rise** `Δ = A·u`
· **wave** `Δ = A·sin(πu − (π/4)(v+1))`. The **2-D families** evaluate over the whole frame, with
`r̂ = √((nx²+ny²)/2)` the corner-normalized radius (1 at the corners, so **corners stay pinned**):
**fisheye** radial magnify `s = 1 + b(1−r̂²)²` (negative bend = pincushion) · **inflate** per-axis
bulge `sx = 1+(b/2)(1−ny²)`, `sy = 1+(b/2)(1−nx²)` · **squeeze** waist pinch
`u′ = u·(1−(b/2)(1−v²))` (negative = barrel) · **twist** angle-true swirl `θ = b·(π/2)·(1−r̂²)²`.
The fisheye/twist profiles are **eased** (squared, so the gradient also vanishes at the pinned
corners): the fields are fold-free at every bend — outlines never self-cross into corner slivers.
The **scale family** rescales the cross-axis coordinate by a profile of `u` about an anchor:
**bulge** `v′ = v·s`, `s = 1+(b/2)(1−u²)` (midline) · **arc-lower / arc-upper** pin one edge and
apply the same `s` from it (the free edge arcs at its center) · **shell-lower / shell-upper** pin
one edge with the *inverted* profile `s = 1+(b/2)u²` (the free edge's corners flare, its center
stays) · **fish** `v′ = v·s`, `s = 1+(b/2)(1−u²−(1+u)²/4)` (neutral nose, bulged body, tail pinched
to `1−b/2`). **Arc** is the one polar field: the box bends into an annular sector spanning
`Θ = bend·π` (a semicircle at 100%) — the midline becomes an arc of radius `R = L/Θ` (its length is
preserved), perpendicular lines become radii, and the envelope relocates (no pinned corners).
Every path then runs the §7.1 bake at the profile tolerance.

**Spine and noise fields.** `field="bend"` (Inkscape's *LPE Bend*) flows the children along a
referenced spine: the envelope's bend-axis extent maps to arc length (placed by `align`/`start`,
exactly the §6.13 semantics), and its cross axis to a normal offset — the envelope's vertical
midline rides the spine; past either end the spine extends straight. It is the §6.13.2 path-follow
field generalized to arbitrary geometry. `field="roughen"` (Illustrator Effect ▸ Roughen) jitters
every outline point by smooth 2-D value noise: amplitude `|bend| · min(hw, hh)/4` at 100%,
wavelength `100/detail`. The noise lattice is **seeded deterministically** — the same input always
compiles to the same output (§4).

**Corner-driven fields.** `field="perspective"` solves the **8-DOF homography** taking the envelope
frame's corners to the authored `corners` (a Gauss-eliminated DLT over the normalized frame;
precomputed once). Straight lines stay straight — and because the bake's error metric is distance to
the mapped **chord segment**, already-straight output is *not* subdivided. A singular corner
configuration (e.g. collinear targets) degrades like an unknown field. Near the map's horizon line
the denominator is clamped, so extreme quads stay bounded (§4). `field="free"` is the cheaper
4-corner **bilinear blend** (AI Free Distort): edges shear rather than converge, no straightness
promise. **`distort-h` / `distort-v`** compose a center-anchored projective taper *after* any field:
offsets from the frame center divide by `w = 1 − (dh/2)·nx − (dv/2)·ny` (clamped away from zero) —
positive `distort-h` grows the right side, positive `distort-v` the bottom.

**Degradation (normative).** A child that cannot become path geometry (live `<text>`, rounded
`<rect>`, `<line>`, `<image>`, `<use>`) is **skipped with a marker comment** — a warp MUST NOT
silently emit unwarped content. An unknown or absent `field`, or no usable geometry, emits the
children **unwarped behind a marker**. A path that fails to bake keeps its original geometry, and
non-finite coordinates never reach the output (§4).

**v1 limits.** A `<g>` child whose subtree still contains non-path geometry is skipped whole; text
must be outlined to participate.

### 7.4 Remaining pillars & deferred [planned]

- **`<x:mesh>`** *(Pillar 3)* — Coons/tensor mesh gradients with **cracks / T-junctions** and
  **transparency (feathering / fade)**, lowered to flat patches / gradient triangles / raster `<image>`.
- **Deferred** (valuable, but no longer headline pillars): **`<x:vstroke>`** variable-width strokes
  (research retained in [Research.md §1](Research.md)) and **`<x:boolean>`** live path algebra.

## 8. Lowering target [implemented]

Output is the **static SVG subset** (resvg's scope): no script, animation, events, or `meshgradient`.
Text lowers to `<text>`/`<tspan>` in v0 (browser-shaped), or to outlined `<path>` on demand (§6.12).
The concrete allow/deny feature list is a pending deliverable ([Plan.md](Plan.md) R6).
